The GAP Council, consisting of a number of senior
mathematicians and computer scientists engaged in a broad spectrum of
areas in computational group theory, was formed in 1995 to provide broad
policy advice for the future development of GAP. It served as an editorial
board for GAP packages until 2024, but its interests extend more broadly, to include
enhancing recognition not only of GAP itself but also of
the whole field of computational group theory. This larger role means,
in particular, that if you become aware of ways in which the Council can
promote greater understanding and awareness of CGT (computational group
theory) we would appreciate your telling us, so we can lend our support.

Although the Council is not intended to be a representative body, its
members come from all over the globe and from many parts of the CGT
landscape, so there is a good chance that you already know, or know of,
at least one Council member. Since one of the Council's roles is to seek
out and encourage the development of new contributions to
GAP, and since we may not be aware of your interests,
we encourage you not to wait to be contacted but to correspond directly
with any of the Council members if you have information that we can use.

In its former role as editorial board, the GAP Council used to
coordinate the process by which submitted GAP packages
were refereed. This process has been abolished by the GAP Council in
February 2024, since there are other avenues for publishing software
that did not exist in the past, such as specialist journals for research
software packages. We still continue the list of deposited packages and
encourage all users to submit their GAP packages to this list.
