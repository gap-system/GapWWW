### People
The GAP Group consists of many different people and
is most interested in close contact to the users of GAP.
On one hand we hope for feedback from users, on the other hand we are
offering to give support to users as well as we can. However with both,
reacting to feedback and giving support, users are kindly asked to
understand that all this is done by colleagues who provide such service
in addition to the work for their regular job.

### Feedback

We hope for feedback in particular in the following instances.

-   **When using GAP.**  If you have used GAP we would appreciate some
    information about your work via an email to the address
    <support@gap-system.org>.

-   **When encountering bugs.**  We strongly appreciate timely reports
    about any bugs in GAP you may encounter. When reporting a bug,
    please follow [these guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/issues/).
    The preferred way to submit bug reports is to use the [GAP issue
    tracker](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues) on GitHub.
    Alternatively, you may send them to <support@gap-system.org>.

### User Support

We offer to react as well as we can to questions, requests for help with
problems, or complaints that you may have. However, for the sake of the
whole user community of GAP, we ask you to separate these into two
different categories.

-   **GAP Support.**  We would like to deal with those topics that are
    more or less local to you, that is, are likely not of interest to
    most of the other GAP users by direct correspondence with you.
    Please send letters about such **local** problems and questions also
    to the address <support@gap-system.org>.

-   **GAP Forum.**  On the other hand, the
    [GAP Forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/forum/)
    should be reserved for discussions about problems that are likely to
    interest many of the GAP users. It would also be welcome if you
    could occasionally tell other users in the GAP Forum about
    interesting applications you have made of GAP. All correspondence in
    the Forum is kept in the
    [Forum Archive]({{ site.baseurl }}/forum/archive/).

    For **theoretical** questions on groups and related structures we
    like to point to the
    [Group-Pub-forum](https://people.bath.ac.uk/masgcs/gpf.html) in
    which such questions are answered and discussed by a large community
    of experts.

### Cooperation

The functionality of GAP has been widely enlarged by pieces of code and
data collections that have been developed by users of GAP and have been
provided to be used with the main GAP library. We distribute these in
the form of [Packages]({{ site.baseurl }}/packages/) and Data Libraries.
We welcome obtaining any further such contributions as well as
references to GAP implementations in the course of your research
projects.

As explained on the respective page we have established a procedure for
formally 'accepting' some packages which we hope will give them a
status comparable to a published paper. On a separate page we inform
about the process of [submitting contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/packages/authors/submit.html).
