abstract: |
    The <span class="pkgname">GBNP</spam> package provides algorithms for    computing Grobner bases of noncommutative polynomials with coefficients    from a field implemented in <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> and with    respect to the "total degree first then lexicographical" ordering.    Further provided are some variations, such as a weighted and truncated    version and a tracing facility. The word "algorithm" is to be    interpreted loosely here: in general one cannot expect such an algorithm    to terminate, as it would imply solvability of the word problem for    finitely presented (semi)groups.
