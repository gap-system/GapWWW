<mixertitle>Tools needed to install <mixer var="GAP"/> from source</mixertitle>

<p>
Installing the <mixer var="GAP"/> distribution with all the packages
and full data libraries takes about 1.2 GB of disk space and (except
for Windows or rsync installations) will require a working C
development environment on your system. This should include a C
compiler (preferably gcc 4.2 or higher), make, binary utilities such
as a linker, and development libraries.  We recommend that you also
install a C++ compiler, as various <mixer var="GAP"/> packages require one. The
<mixer var="GAP"/> build system will enable special support for such packages
if the presence of a C++ compiler is detected while building <mixer var="GAP"/>.
You will also need the m4 macro processor; most, but not all standard
development environments include this. Furthermore, if the readline
library is detected on your system at compile time, it will be used
for command line editing.
</p>

<p>
On Mac OS X, you need to install the Apple developer tools.
These can be obtained as part of Apple's "Xcode" application, free of 
charge via the Mac App Store or via 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">http://developer.apple.com/xcode/</a>.
If you are on Mac OS X 10.7 or later, then after downloading and installing 
Xcode, you need to perform one extra step: launch Xcode, then open its 
Preferences dialog, and go to the "Downloads" pane. You will be presented 
with an optional list of extra components. From there, install the 
"Command Line tools" component. For Mac OS X 10.6 or earlier, some
(possibly already outdated) version of Xcode may be contained on 
your Mac OS X Installer DVD.
</p>

<p>
Since Windows binaries for <mixer var="GAP"/> and some packages
are contained in the -win.zip archive and <mixer var="GAP"/> 
installer for Windows, you do not need to install any additional 
tools for Windows. However, if you want to try to build binaries 
for more packages, you may install  <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>
to get a UNIX environment for Windows, selecting all needed tools 
during Cygwin installation.
</p>

<p>
To install development tools on a Linux system, use your preferred package 
manager (e.g. apt-get or aptitude or Synaptic etc.). For example, on Ubuntu
you may try to call 'apt-get install build-essential m4 libreadline6-dev libncurses5-dev'
before calling 'configure' in the <mixer var="GAP"/> root directory.
</p>

<p>
To get maximum benefit from GAP and from various packages it may be useful 
to install a number of other free software libraries (and their associated 
development tools) although they are not required for basic operation. 
For example, 
<dl>
<dt><a href="../Packages/browse.html">Browse</a></dt>
	<dd>needs the ncurses library
	(e.g. libncurses5-dev and libncursesw5-dev);</dd>
<dt><a href="../Packages/nq.html">nq</a></dt>
	<dd> needs some version of awk
	(e.g. gawk or mawk);</dd>
<dt><a href="../Packages/fr.html">FR</a></dt>
	<dd> may need wget;</dd>
<dt><a href="../Packages/xgap.html">XGAP</a></dt>
	<dd>requires the following X11 libraries: libXaw, libXmu, libXt,
	libXext, libX11, libSM, and libICE
	(e.g. libx11-dev, libxaw7-dev, libxt-dev which possibly aready install
	the other four libxmu-dev, libxext-dev, libsm-dev, libice-dev);</dd>
<dt><a href="../Packages/pargap.html">ParGAP</a></dt>
	<dd> needs an MPI implementation such as OpenMPI or MPICH2
	but optionally may use the MPINU library supplied with the package.</dd>
</dl>
Other packages not listed here may have additional requirements listed in their documentation.
</p>

<h2>Using other compilers</h2>

<p>
The recommended C compiler for <mixer var="GAP"/> is the GNU C
compiler gcc, version 4.2 or higher. The clang compiler appears to
compile GAP itself correctly but, just as for gcc, some versions have
problems with the GMP library. If you cannot build GAP - with or
without GMP - using a particular compiler, you may wish to try another
compiler or different version of the same compiler.
</p>

<p>
If you do wish to use another compiler, you should run the command 'make
clean' in the GAP root directory, set the environment variable CC to
the name of your preferred compiler and then rerun configure and make. You
may have to experiment to determine the best values for CFLAGS and/or COPTS.
Please let us (support@gap-system.org) know the results of your experiments.
