<p>
Errors listed in <b>bold</b> may cause the system to return a wrong result
without issuing a warning, errors in <i>italics</i> can cause a system
crash. Other errors typically will lead to an error message and may cause
the abortion of a run but will not cause wrong results.

<ol>
<li>
 A problem with a homomorphism from a free group in the trivial
    permutation group.
 </li>
<li>
 A problem with the multiplication of rationals and elements in
    large prime fields.
 </li>
<li>
 <b>A problem with composing a homomorphism from an fp group with another
    homomorphism (images may be wrong).</b>
 </li>
<li>
 A problem with attempting to create univariate polynomials of very
    high degree.
 </li>
<li>
 A problem with output going to <b>errout</b> incorrectly after a syntax error
 </li>
<li>
 An error in the function ReducedSCTable.
 </li>
<li>
 An error in computing the Rees Matrix semigroup.
 </li>
<li>
 A compatibility problem with earlier versions of gap in semigroup
    and monoid rewriting systems.
 </li>
<li>
 <b>An error in the comparison routine for univariate rational
 functions.</b>
</li>
<li>
The behaviour of PQuotient() when an attempt is made to compute a
    p-quotient with more generators than the underlying data structure
    was initialised with. 
</li>
<li>
A problem with computing `BasisVectors' for a basis of an algebraic
    field extension.
</li>
<li>
A problem with the definition of `IsRowVector' (which previously
    returned `true' also for matrices).
</li>
<li>
A problem with `BaumClausenInfo'.
</li>
<li>
A problem with `IsRowModule' for infinite dimensional vector spaces
    (which are not row spaces).
</li>
<li>
<b>
A problem when calculating representations of a group in which class
    arrangement in group and character table are not identical.</b>
</li>
<li>
A problem with `Difference' with first argument a list that is not a set
    and second argument an empty list.
</li>
<li>
The failure of Elements() to compute the elements of a pc group
    with non-prime relative orders.
</li>
<li>
A wrong computation of single character values of Weyl groups of type B
    and character tables of Weyl groups of type D. Furthermore, a much more
    efficient function for computing all character values is provided.
</li>
<li>
Packages accidentally overwriting the setting of `InfoWarning'.
</li>
<li>
A missing method for `IsPolynomial' for univariate rational functions.
</li>
<li>
A problem in the on-line help which sometimes returned a blank entry for
    a topic even though the topic was documented.
</li>
<li>
A problem in the help system where a tilde in a filename was replaced by
    a blank.
</li>
<li>
A problem that prevented the documentation of some packages from 
    autoloading.
</li>
<li>
<b>
Three missing primitive groups of degree 441 were addded.
