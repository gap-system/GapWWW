<p>
Errors listed in <b>bold</b> may cause the system to return a wrong result
without issuing a warning, errors in <i>italics</i> can cause a system
crash. Other errors typically will lead to an error message and may cause
the abortion of a run but will not cause wrong results.
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>A wrong return format for `IsomorphicSubgroups' applied to cyclic groups.</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>A wrong `true' result of `IsSubset' for certain algebras.</b>
</li>
<li><i>Segmentation faults and other strange behaviour when assigning
    finite field elements of different characteristics into compressed vectors</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>A bug in the subgroup conjugation test for permutation groups that are
    not subgroups.</b>
</li>
<li>
A missing method for `BaseOrthogonalSpaceMat'.
</li>
<li>
A missing `Set' call in the construction of the global variable
    `AUTOLOAD_PACKAGES'.
</li>
<li>
A wrong display string of the numerator in rational functions returned
    by `MolienSeries' (in the case that the constant term of this numerator
    is zero).
</li>
<li>
<b>A strange behaviour of `Intersection' for the case that a strictly
    sorted list is the unique entry of the list that is given as the
    argument; in this situation, this entry itself was returned instead of
    a shallow copy.</b>
</li>
<li>
An error in the basis of a product space of algebras.
</li>
<li>
<b>Possibly wrong result of `Centre' for pc groups.</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Possibly wrong result of `DirectSumDecomposition' for matrix Lie algebras. </b>
</li>
<li>
An error in `LieNormalizer', `LieCentralizer' for zero subspaces.
</li>
<li>
An error in the computation of matrices of adjoint modules.
</li>
<li>
A strange error message when constructing the simple Lie algebra of type B1.
</li>
<li>
An error in `ModuleByRestriction'.
</li>
<li>
An error in `IrrBaumClausen' for the trivial group.
</li>
<li>
An error with vector space bases of row spaces over fields which
    neither are prime fields nor contain all entries of the vectors.
</li>
<li>
An error with `IsMonomial', when it uses the function
    `TestMonomialFromLattice' (i.e., in hard cases, likely for characters of
    nonsolvable groups).
 </li>
</ol>
