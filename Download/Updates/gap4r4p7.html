<!-- descriptions of fixes: -->
<h3>New or improved functionality</h3>
<ol>

<li>
The {% include coderef.html manual="Reference: Display" text="Display" %} functionality for character tables has been extended by addition 
of an option to show power maps and centralizer orders in a format
similar to that used in the ATLAS.
Furthermore the options handling is now hierarchical,
in order to admit more flexible overloading.
</li>

<li>
For the function {% include coderef.html manual="Reference: LowIndexSubgroupsFpGroup" text="LowIndexSubgroupsFpGroup" %},
there is now an {% include ref.html manual="Reference: Iterators" text="iterator" %} variant
<span class="code">LowIndexSubgroupsFpGroupIterator</span>.
[Suggested (and based on code contributed) by Michael Hartley]
</li>

<li>
Semigroup functionality in <span class="code">GAP</span> has been improved 
and extended. Green's relations are now stored differently, making the system 
more amenable to new methods for computing these relations in special cases. 
It is now possible to calculate 
Green's classes etc. without computing the entire semigroup or necessarily 
loading the package <span class="pkgname">MONOID</span>. 
Furthermore, the Froidure-Pin algorithm has now been implemented in 
<span class="code">GAP</span>. 
</li>

<li>
Functionality for creating free products of any list of groups for which 
a finite presentation can be determined had been added. This
function returns a finitely presented group. This functionality includes
the <span class="code">Embedding</span> operation.

As an application of this new code a specialized direct product 
operation has been added for finitely presented groups which 
returns a finitely presented group. This application includes 
<span class="code">Embedding</span> and <span class="code">Projection</span> functionality.
</li>

<li>
Some new Straight Line Program (SLP) functionality has been added. 
The new functions take given SLPs and create new ones by restricting
to a subset of the results, or to an intermediate result or by calculating
the product of the results of two SLPs.
</li>

<li>
New code has been added to allow group elements with memory;
that is, they store
automatically how they were derived from some given set of generators.
Note that there is not yet documentation for this functionality,
but some packages already use it.
</li>

<li>
New code has been added to handle matrices and vectors in such a way that 
they do not change their representation in a generic manner.
</li>

<li>
The {% include coderef.html manual="Reference: Irr" text="Irr" %}
method for p-solvable p-modular Brauer tables now keeps the order of the
irreducibles in the ordinary table.
</li>

<li>
<span class="pkgname">GAP</span> can now handle any finite field for which the 
Conway polynomial is known or can be computed. 
</li>

<li>
New Conway polynomials provided by John Bray and Kate Minola have been added.
</li>

<li>
The <span class="code">ReadTest</span>
methods for strings (filenames) and streams now automatically set
the screen width (see {% include coderef.html manual="Reference: SizeScreen" text="SizeScreen" %}) to 80 before the tests,
and reset it afterwards.
</li>

<li>
Now a few more checks are done during the <span class="code">configure</span>
phase of compiling for future use of some I/O functions of the C-library
in a package. Also the path to the <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> binaries for the <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> compiler is 
now handled via autoconf. Finally, now <span class="code">autoconf</span>
version 2.59 is used.
</li>

</ol>

<h3>Fixed bugs which could produce wrong results</h3>
<ol>

<li>
Some technical errors in the functions for compressed vectors and matrices
which could lead to corruption of internal data structures and so to crashes
or conceivably to wrong results. [Reported by Roman Schmied]
</li>

<li>
A potential problem in the generic method for the undocumented operation
<span class="code">DirectFactorsOfGroup</span>:
It was silently assumed that
{% include coderef.html manual="Reference: NormalSubgroups" text="NormalSubgroups" %}
delivers the trivial subgroup as first and
the whole group as last entry of the resulting list.
</li>

<li>
The code for sublists of compressed vectors created by <span class="code">vec{range}</span> may write 
one byte beyond the space allocated for the new vector, overwriting part of the next
object in the workspace. Thanks to Jack Schmidt for narrowing down the problem.
</li>

<li>
Given a class function object of value zero, an 
{% include coderef.html manual="Reference: Arithmetic Operations for Class Functions" text="InverseOp" %} method for a class function
erroneously did not return <span class="code">fail</span>. 
[Reported by Jack Schmidt]
</li>

<li>
The {% include coderef.html manual="Reference: Arithmetic Operations for Class Functions" text="Order" %} method for a class function
erroneously returned a finite number if one of the values
was nonreal, not a cyclotomic integer, and had norm 1.
</li>

<li>
Two missing perfect groups were added, and the permutation degree lowered on
the perfect groups with the largest degrees. [Reported by Jack Schmidt]
</li>

<li>
When a character table was displayed with
{% include coderef.html manual="Reference: Printing Character Tables" text="Display" %},
the centralizer order displayed for the first class shown
was not correct if it did not involve
all prime divisors of the group. [Reported by Jack Schmidt]
</li>

<li>
The first argument of the function {% include coderef.html manual="Reference: VectorSpace" text="VectorSpace" %} must be a field.
This is checked from now on. [Reported by Laurent Bartholdi]
</li>

<li>
Up to now, it was possible to create a group object from a semigroup of
cyclotomics using {% include coderef.html manual="Reference: AsGroup" text="AsGroup" %},
although groups of cyclotomics are not admissible. [Reported by Alexander Konovalov]
</li>

<li>
The documentation of 
<span class="code">CharacteristicPolynomial(F,mat)</span> 
was ambiguous if
<span class="code">FieldOfMatrix(mat) &le; F &lt; 
DefaultFieldOfMatrix(mat)</span>.
In particular, the
result was representation dependent. This was fixed by introducing a second
field which specifies the vector space which mat acts upon.  [Reported by Jack Schmidt]
</li>

<li>
<span class="code">AssociatedReesMatrixSemigroupOfDClass</span> produced an incorrect 
sandwich matrix for the semigroup created. This matrix is an
attribute set when creating the Rees matrix semigroup but is 
not used for creating the semigroup. The incorrect result was returned
when <span class="code">SandwichMatrix</span> was called. [Reported by Nelson Silva and Joao Araujo]
</li>

<li>
The literal <span class="code">"compiled"</span> was given an incorrect length. The 
kernel was then unable to find compiled library code as the search
path was incorrect. Also the documentation example had an error in 
the path used to invoke the gac compiler.
</li>

<li>
The twisting group in a generic wreath product might have had intransitive action. [Reported by Laurent Bartholdi]
</li>

<li>
There was an arithmetic bug in the polynomial reduction code.
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Fixed bugs which could lead to crashes</h3>
<ul>

<li>
Bug 1 in the list of fixed bugs which could lead to wrong results
could also potentially lead to crashes.
</li>

</ul>


<h3>Other fixed bugs</h3>
<ol>

<li>
The matrices of invariant forms stored as values of the attributes
{% include coderef.html manual="Reference: InvariantBilinearForm" text="InvariantBilinearForm" %},
{% include coderef.html manual="Reference: InvariantQuadraticForm" text="InvariantQuadraticForm" %}, and
{% include coderef.html manual="Reference: InvariantSesquilinearForm" text="InvariantSesquilinearForm" %},
for matrix groups over finite fields,
are now in the (compressed) format returned by
{% include coderef.html manual="Reference: ImmutableMatrix" text="ImmutableMatrix" %}.
</li>

<li>
<span class="code">String</span> now returns an immutable string, 
by making a copy before changing the argument. 
</li>

<li>
Permutation ^0 and permutation ^1 were not handled with special code in
the kernel, hence were very slow for big permutations.
[Reported by Max Neunhoeffer]
</li>

<li>
Added code to cache the induced pcgs for an arbitrary parent pcgs. (This code
was formerly part of the <span class="pkgname">CRISP</span> package.)
</li>

<li>
This fix consists of numerous changes to improve support for 
direct products, including:
- new methods for <span class="code">PcgsElementaryAbelianSeries</span>,
<span class="code">PcgsChiefSeries</span>,
<span class="code">ExponentsOfPcElement</span>, 
<span class="code">DepthOfPcElement</span> for direct products
- fixed <span class="code">EnumeratorOfPcgs</span> to test for membership first
- new methods for membership test in groups which have an induced pcgs
- added <span class="code">GroupOfPcgs</span> attribute to pcgs in various methods
- fixed declarations of <span class="code">PcgsElementaryAbelianSeries</span>, 
<span class="code">PcgsChiefSeries</span>
(the declared argument was a pcgs, not a group) [Reported by Roman Schmied]
</li>

<li>
Corrected a term ordering problem encountered by the basis construction
code for finite dimensional vector spaces of multivariate rational functions. [Reported by Jan Draisma]
</li>

<li>
When the factor of a finite dimensional group ring by an ideal was formed,
a method intended for free algebras modulo relations was used,
and the returned factor algebra could be used for (almost) nothing. [Reported by Heiko Dietrich]
</li>

<li>
Up to now, {% include coderef.html manual="Reference: PowerMap" text="PowerMap" %} ran into an error
when one asked for the n-th power map where n was not a small integer.
This happened in some <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> library functions
if the exponent of the character table in question was not a small integer.
</li>

<li>
Up to now, the test whether a finite field element was contained in a group
of finite field elements ran into an error if the element was not in the
field generated by the group elements. [Reported by Heiko Dietrich]
</li>

<li>
Conjugacy classes of natural (special) linear groups are now always returned
with trivial class first.
</li>

<li>
Up to now, it could happen that {% include coderef.html manual="Reference: CheckFixedPoints" text="CheckFixedPoints" %} reduced an entry in its
second argument to a list containing only one integer
but did not replace the list by that integer;
according to the conventions, this replacement should be done.
</li>

<li> 
The functions <span class="code">PrintTo</span> and 
<span class="code">AppendTo</span> did not work correctly for streams.
[Reported by Marco Costantini]
</li>

<li>
The function <span class="code">Basis</span> did not return a value
when it was called with the argument <span class="code">Rationals</span>.
[Reported by Klaus Lux]
</li>

<li>
For certain matrix groups, the function
<span class="code">StructureDescription</span> raised an error message.
The reason for this was that a trivial method for
<span class="code">IsGeneralLinearGroup</span> for matrix groups in
<span class="code">lib/grpmat.gi</span> which is ranked higher than
the nontrivial method for generic groups in
<span class="code">lib/grpnames.gi</span> called the operation
<span class="code">IsNaturalGL</span>, for which there was no nontrivial
method available. [Reported by Nilo de Roock]
</li>

<li> 
Action on sets of length 1 was not correctly handled. [Reported by Mathieu Dutour]
</li>

<li>
Now <span class="code">WriteByte</span> admits writing zero characters to
all streams. [Reported by Marco Costantini]
</li>

<li>
The conjugacy test for subgroups tests for elementary abelian regular normal subgroup (EARNS) conjugacy. The fix will 
catch this in the case that the second group has no EARNS. 
[Reported by Andrew Johnson]
</li>

<li>
So far, the UNIX installation didn't result in a correct gap.sh if the 
installation path contained space characters. Now it should handle this 
case correctly, as well as other unusual characters in path names 
(except for double quotes).
</li>

</ol>
