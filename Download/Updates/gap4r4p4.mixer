<p>
Errors listed in <b>bold</b> may cause the system to return a wrong result
without issuing a warning, errors in <i>italics</i> can cause a system
crash. Other errors typically will lead to an error message and may cause
the abortion of a run but will not cause wrong results.
</p>

<ol>
<li> A problem with the function `SuggestUpdates' to check for the most recent
     version of packages available.
</li>
<li> A problem that caused `MatrixOfAction' to produce an error when
     the algebra module was constructed as a direct sum.
</li>
<li> <b> An error in the `Order' method for matrices over cyclotomic fields
     which caused this method to return `infinity' for matrices of finite
     order in certain cases. </b>
</li>
<li> <b> Representations computed by `IrreducibleRepresentations' in
     characteristic 0 erraneously claimed to be faithful. </b>
</li>
<li> Problems with computing n-th power maps of character tables,
     where n is negative and the table does not yet store its irreducible
     characters.
</li>
<li> <b> A primitive representation of degree 574 for PSL(2,41) has been missing
     in the classification on which the GAP library was built. </b>
</li>
<li> Element conjugacy in large-base permutation groups sometimes was
     unnecessarily inefficient.
</li>
<li> <b> A bug in 'Append' for compressed vectors over GF(2), if the length
     of the result is 1 mod 32 (or 64) the last entry was forgotten to copy. </b>
</li>
<li> <b> A problem with the Ree group Ree(3) of size 1512 claiming to be
     simple. </b>
</li>
<li> <b> An error in the membership test (`in') for groups `GU(n,q)' and
     `SU(n,q)' for non-prime `q'. </b>
</li>
<li> A missing method for getting the letter representation of an associate
     word in straight line program representation.
</li>
<li> A problem with the construction of vector space bases where the given
     list of basis vectors is itself an object that was returned by `Basis'.
</li>
<li> <b> An error in the kernel code for ranges which caused `-1 in [1..2]' to
     return `true', e.g. </b>
</li>
<li> <b> An error recording Boolean lists in saved workspaces.</b>
</li>
<li> A problem of `AbelianInvariantsMultiplier' insisting that a result of
    `IsomorphismFpGroup' is known to be surjective.
</li>
<li> <b> A problem in the selection function for primitive and
     transitive groups if no degree is given.</b>
</li>
<li> An error in the routine for `Resultant' if one of the polynomials has
    degree zero.
</li>
<li> <b> `ReducedConfluentRewritingSystem' returning a cached result that might
    not conform to the ordering specified. </b>
</li>
