<p>
Errors listed in <b>bold</b> may cause the system to return a wrong result
without issuing a warning, errors in <i>italics</i> can cause a system
crash. Other errors typically will lead to an error message and may cause
the abortion of a run but will not cause wrong results.
</p>

<ol>
<li><i>A crash when incorrect types of arguments are passed to
FileString.</i>
</li>
<li>A bug in `DerivedSubgroupTom' and `DerivedSubgroupsTom'.
</li>
<li>An error in the inversion of certain `ZmodnZObj' elements.
</li>
<li>A wrong display string of the numerator in rational functions returned
   by `MolienSeriesWithGivenDenominator' (in the case that the constant
   term of this numerator is zero).
</li>
</ol>
