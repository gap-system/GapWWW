<mixertitle><mixer var="GAP"/> 4.4 Update 8 (September 2006)</mixertitle>

<h3>New or improved functionality</h3>
<ol>

<li>
A function <mixer manual="Reference: Positions"><span class="code">Positions</span></mixer> with underlying operation
<span class="code">PositionsOp</span>, which returns the list
of all positions at which a given object appears in a given list.
</li>

<li>
<mixer manual="Reference: LogFFE"><span class="code">LogFFE</span></mixer> 
now returns  <span class="code">fail</span> 
when the element is not a power of the base.
</li>

<li>
It is now allowed to continue long integers, strings or identifiers by
ending a line with a backslash or with a backslash and carriage return
character. So, files with <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> code and 
DOS/Windows-style  line breaks  are now valid input on all architectures.
</li>

<li>
The command line for starting the session and the system environment are now
available in <span class="code">GAPInfo.SystemCommandLine</span> and
<span class="code">GAPInfo.SystemEnvironment</span>.
</li>

<li>
Names of all bound global variables and all component names are available 
on <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> level.
</li>

<li>
Added a few new Conway polynomials computed by Kate Minola and John Bray.
</li>

<li>
There is a new concept of <em>random sources</em>, see <mixer
manual="Reference: IsRandomSource"><span
class="code">IsRandomSource</span></mixer>, which provides random number 
generators which are independent of each other.
<p>There is kernel code for the <mixer manual="Reference:
IsMersenneTwister">Mersenne twister</mixer> random number generator
(based on the code by Makoto Matsumoto distributed 
<a href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html">here</a>).
It provides fast 32 bit pseudo random integers with a period of length 
2^19937-1
and a 623-dimensional equidistribution. The library methods for random
elements of lists and for random (long) integers (<span
class="code">Random(low, high)</span>) are using the Mersenne twister now.</p>
</li>

<li>
In line editing mode (usual input mode without -n option) in lines starting
with <span class="code">gap&gt; </span>, <span class="code">&gt; </span> or
<span class="code">brk&gt; </span> this beginning part is immediately
removed. This is a convenient feature that allows one to cut and paste
input lines from other sessions or from manual examples into the current 
session.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Fixed bugs which could produce wrong results</h3>
<ol>

<li>
The function <mixer manual="Reference: Decomposition"><span class="code">
Decomposition</span></mixer> returned coefficient vectors also in certain
situations where in fact no decomposition exists.
This happened only if the matrix entered as the first argument
contained irrational values
and a row in the matrix entered as the second argument did not respect the
algebraic conjugacy relations between the columns of the first argument.
So there was no problem for the usual cases that the two matrices are
integral or that they are lists of Brauer characters. [Reported by Jürgen Müller]
</li>

<li>
PC group homomorphisms can claim a wrong kernel after composition. [Reported by Serge Bouc]
</li>

<li>
The return value of <mixer manual="Reference: OctaveAlgebra">
<span class="code">OctaveAlgebra</span></mixer> had an inconsistent
defining structure constants table for the case of coefficients fields
not containing the integer zero. [Reported by Gábor Nagy]
</li>

<li>
The manual guarantees that a conjugator automorphism has a conjugating
element in the group if possible. This was not guaranteed.
</li>

<li>
<mixer manual="Reference: StabChain for a group (and a record)"><span class="code">StabChain</span></mixer>
for symmetric groups gave a wrong result if fixed points were
prescribed for base.
</li>

<li>
Contrary to what is documented the function 
<span class="code">POW_OBJ_INT</span> returned an immutable result for
<span class="code">POW_OBJ_INT(m,1)</span> for a mutable object
<span class="code">m</span>. This is triggered by the code
<span class="code">m^1</span>.
</li>

<li>
<mixer manual="Reference: PseudoRandom"><span 
class="code">PseudoRandom</span></mixer> for a group 
had a problem if the group had lots of equal
generators. The produced elements were extremely poorly distributed in 
that case. This is now fixed for the case that elements of the group
can easily be sorted.
</li>

<li>
Fixed the bug that the type of a <mixer 
manual="Reference: More about Boolean Lists">blist</mixer> was 
computed wrongly: The
type previously had <span class="code">IS_PLIST_REP</span> instead 
of <span class="code">IS_BLIST_REP</span> in its filter list.
</li>

<li>
<mixer manual="Reference: Orbits"><span class="code">Orbits</span></mixer> 
did not respect a special <mixer manual="Reference: PositionCanonical"><span
class="code">PositionCanonical</span></mixer> method for right
transversals. [Reported by Steve Costenoble]
</li>

<li>
Wrong results for <mixer manual="Reference: GcdInt"><span 
class="code">GcdInt</span></mixer> for some arguments on 64 bit systems only.
 [Reported by Robert Morse]
</li>

<li>
When prescribing a subgroup to be included, the low index algorithm for fp
groups sometimes returned subgroups which are in fact conjugate. (No
subgroups are missing.) [Reported by Ignaz Soroko]
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Fixed bugs which could lead to crashes</h3>
<ol>

<li>
The command line option <span class="code">-x</span> allowed 
arguments > 256 which
can then result in internal buffers overflowing. Now bigger numbers
in the argument are equivalent to <span class="code">-x 256</span>.
<!-- 
Can't really test it except by starting gap -x 300 and checking SizeScreen();
With the fix it is [256,24], without it was [300,24]. -->
[Reported by Michael Hartley]
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Other fixed bugs</h3>
<ol>

<li>
Two special methods for the operation
<mixer manual="Reference: CompositionMapping2"><span class="code">
CompositionMapping2</span></mixer> were not correct,
such that composing (and multiplying) certain group homomorphisms
did not work. [Reported by Peter Mayr]
</li>

<li>
In the definition of
<mixer manual="Reference: FrobeniusCharacterValue"><span class="code">
FrobeniusCharacterValue</span></mixer>, it had been stated erroneously
that the value must lie in the field of p<sup>n</sup>-th roots of unity;
the correct condition is that the value must lie in the field of
(p<sup>n</sup>-1)-th roots of unity. [Reported by Jack Schmidt]
</li>

<li>
The function <mixer manual="Reference: DirectProduct"><span class="code">
DirectProduct</span></mixer> failed when one of the factors was known to be
infinite.
</li>

<li>
For a linear action homomorphism <span class="code">PreImageElm</span>
was very slow because there was no good method to check for injectivity,
which is needed for nearly all good methods for 
<span class="code">PreImageElm</span>. This change adds such a new
method for <span class="code">IsInjective</span>. [Reported by Akos Seress]
</li>

<li>
Rare errors in the complement routine for permutation groups.
</li>

<li>
Blocks code now uses jellyfish-style random elements to avoid bad Schreier
trees.
</li>

<li>
A method for <mixer manual="Reference: IsPolycyclicGroup"><span 
class="code">IsPolycyclicGroup</span></mixer> has been added.
Such a method was missing so far.
</li>

<li>
Corrected <mixer manual="Reference: EpimorphismSchurCover"><span 
class="code">EpimorphismSchurCover</span></mixer> to handle
the trivial group correctly.
Added new methods that follow immediately from computing 
the Schur Cover of a group. The attribute 
<mixer manual="Reference: Epicentre">
<span class="code">Epicentre</span></mixer>, the operations
<mixer manual="Reference: NonabelianExteriorSquare">
<span class="code">NonabelianExteriorSquare</span></mixer> and
<mixer manual="Reference: EpimorphismNonabelianExteriorSquare">
<span class="code">EpimorphismNonabelianExteriorSquare</span></mixer>, and
the property <mixer manual="Reference: IsCentralFactor"><span 
class="code">IsCentralFactor</span></mixer> are added to the 
library with documentation and references.
</li>

<li>
Display the correct expression in a call stack trace
if an operation was called somewhere up due to the evaluation
of a unary or binary operation.
</li>

<li>
Made <span class="code">StripMemory</span> an operation rather than a 
global function. Added <span class="code">ForgetMemory</span> operation.
</li>

<li>
Adjust things slightly to make later conversion to new vectors/matrices
easier. Nothing of this should be visible.
</li>

<li>
Corrected some details in the documentation of the <span
class="pkgname">GAP</span> language. [Reported by Alexander Konovalov]
</li>

<li>
Now <mixer manual="Reference: PositionSorted"><span 
class="code">PositionSorted</span></mixer> is much faster on long mutable 
plain lists. (The former operation is substituted by a function and a new
operation <span class="code">PositionSortedOp</span>.) [Reported by Radu Silviu]
</li>

<li>
Now it is possible to switch repeated warnings off when working with
iterative polynomial rings.
</li>
</ol>
