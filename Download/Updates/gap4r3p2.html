<p>
Errors listed in <b>bold</b> may cause the system to return a wrong result
without issuing a warning, errors in <i>italics</i> can cause a system
crash. Other errors typically will lead to an error message and may cause
the abortion of a run but will not cause wrong results.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<i>
A segmentation fault when appending to a length 0 compressed vector
  over GF2.
</i>
</li>
<li>
An error in the computation of inverses in quaternion algebras with
  non-standard parameters.
</li>
<li>
<b>
The result of 'ProjectiveSymplecticGroup(n,q);'.
</b>
</li>
<li>
`GeneratorOfCyclicGroup' for a trivial pc group.
</li>
<li>
A problem in backtrack routines using `Suborbits' if the group has
  fixed points in the range [1..max(Omega)].
</li>
<li>
A problem with `CharacterTableDirectProduct' if exactly one argument
  is a Brauer table.
</li>
<li>
Problems with `IntScalarProduct' and `NonnegIntScalarProducts'
  if the third argument is not a plain list (this situation does not occur
  in GAP library functions).
</li>
<li>
A Problem with GQuotient
</li>
<li>
A problem with the linear algebra methods for Lie algebra cohomology.
</li>
<li>
A Problem with requesting transitive groups of degree including 1
</li>
<li>
A Problem with inverting lists of compressed vectors over fields
  of order greater than 2.
</li>
<li>
An error in computing whether an element is in a Green's D equivalence
  class or not.
</li>
<li>
A missing method for `MovedPoints(perm)'
</li>
<li>
The method IsGreensLessThanOrEqual should work for Green's D classes for
  finite groups.
</li>
<li>
The method GroupHClassOfGreensDClass was not implemented and is required
  for the Rees Matrix methods.
</li>
<li>
The methods AssociatedReesMatrixSemigroupOfDClass, IsZeroSimpleSemigroup,
  IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup, and SandwichMatrixOfReesZeroMatrixSemigroup
  all create Greens classes using obsolete methods which for some semigroups
  leads to infinite recursion or causes GAP to stop with an error message.
</li>
<li>
A problem with `CentralizerModulo' for permutation groups.
</li>
<li>
A wrong name for PGL(2,49) in the primitive groups library of degree 50
</li>
<li>
Missing `Representative' methods for certain trivial groups and
  trivial spaces.
</li>
<li>
A missing setting of `IndicesNormalSteps'
</li>
</ol>
