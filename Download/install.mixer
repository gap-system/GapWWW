<h3>The Basic Steps of a <mixer var="GAP"/> Installation</h3>

<p>
Note that to obtain a fully functional GAP installation you need not only to 
compile the core system, but also some of its packages. You might want to consider 
one of the <a href="index.html#alternatives">alternative installation methods</a>
below which achieve this for you automatically. Otherwise, to install 
<mixer var="GAP"/> using the source distribution, perform the following steps:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose your preferred archive format and <a href="#Download">download</a> 
the corresponding archive.</li>
<li>Unpack the archive.</li>
<li>On UNIX, Linux or Mac OS X: compile the <mixer var="GAP"/> core system.</li>
<li>On UNIX, Linux or Mac OS X: change to the <code>pkg</code> subdirectory and call
<code>../bin/BuildPackages.sh</code> to run the script which will build most of
the packages that require compilation (provided sufficiently many libraries, headers
and tools are available). If something doesn't work on your system, please
refer to the <code>README</code> file provided with the corresponding package. 
</li>
<li>On Windows: no compilation is needed, compiled executables for <mixer var="GAP"/> 
and some packages are already in the win.zip-archive.</li>
<li>Adjust some links/scripts/icons ..., depending on your system, to
make the new version of <mixer var="GAP"/> available to the users of
your machine.</li>
<li>Optional: run a few tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For detailed installation instructions for the <mixer var="GAP"/> source
distribution on UNIX (which includes the popular variant Linux), on Apple 
computers under OS X, and on Windows see the <a href="INSTALL">INSTALL</a> file, 
which may also be found in the <mixer var="GAP"/> root directory after 
unpacking the archive with the <mixer var="GAP"/> distribution.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Optional:</strong>
<mixer var="GAP"/> starts up much faster using a so called <i>workspace</i>.
A workspace can be generated and used as shown in 
the script <a href="CreateWorkspace.sh"><code>CreateWorkspace.sh</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that the <code>CreateWorkspace.sh</code> script may require
<code>chmod&nbsp;+x&nbsp;CreateWorkspace.sh</code> first.
