<h2>
  Alternative <mixer var="GAP"/> distributions
</h2>

<p>
  To obtain a fully functional <mixer var="GAP"/> installation 
  you need not only to compile the core system, but also some of its 
  packages. If you install <mixer var="GAP"/>  as described on the page 
  <a href="/Download/index.html">Downloading&nbsp;and&nbsp;Installing&nbsp;<mixer var="GAP4"/></a>,
  then after compiling the core <mixer var="GAP"/> system you have to run in the 
  <code>pkg</code> subdirectory the shell script <code>../bin/BuildPackages.sh</code>
  in order to build most of the packages that require compilation provided 
  sufficiently many libraries, headers and tools are available.
</p>

<p>
  You might want to consider one of the alternative installation methods
  below which simplify the installation of <mixer var="GAP"/> and its packages
  by further automation or by offering precompiled binaries. Please note that
  these alternatives may not provide access to the latest public <mixer var="GAP"/>
  release, and it may take a while until they will be updated.
</p>

<h3>
  Homebrew
</h3>

<a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is the package manager for OS X. 
It has a formula to install <mixer var="GAP"/>, provided by Alexey Muranov. 
If you have installed Homebrew, for the new  <mixer var="GAP"/> installation 
you need to call these two commands:
<pre>
brew update
brew install homebrew/science/gap --with-packages
</pre>
To upgrade existing <mixer var="GAP"/> installation made with Homebrew, call 
<pre>
brew update
brew upgrade gap
</pre>
This may take some time, so please be patient.



<h3>
  Docker
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker">Docker</a> is a virtualisation
software. There is a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/gapsystem/gap-docker/">
prebuilt Docker image for <mixer var="GAP"/> and most of the packages</a>, provided by 
Sebastian Gutsche, Alexander Konovalov and Sarah Mount. It contains additional 
software, used by some <mixer var="GAP"/> packages, including Ubuntu packages 
libmpfr-dev, libmpfi-dev libmpc-dev libfplll-dev (needed by the Float package),
PARI/GP, Polymake, Singular and 4ti2.

If you have installed Docker, first you need to download the <mixer var="GAP"/> 
container using
<pre>
docker pull gapsystem/gap-docker
</pre>
After that, you may just type
<pre>
docker run --rm -i -t gapsystem/gap-docker gap
</pre>
to start <mixer var="GAP"/>. Note that you may have to run it with sudo,
particularly if you are on Ubuntu. Further instructions could be found
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/gapsystem/gap-docker/">here</a>.
