<h2>
  Alternative <mixer var="GAP"/> distributions
</h2>

<p>
  To obtain a fully functional <mixer var="GAP"/> installation 
  you need not only to compile the core system, but also some of its 
  packages. If you install <mixer var="GAP"/>  as described on the page 
  <a href="/Download/index.html">Downloading&nbsp;and&nbsp;Installing&nbsp;<mixer var="GAP4"/></a>,
  then after compiling the core <mixer var="GAP"/> system you have to run in the 
  <code>pkg</code> subdirectory the shell script 
  <a href="../Download/InstPackages.sh"><code>InstPackages.sh</code></a> 
  or <a href="../Download/InstPackages32.sh"><code>InstPackages32.sh</code></a>
  in order to build most of the packages that require compilation provided 
  sufficiently many libraries, headers and tools are available.
</p>

<p>
  You might want to consider one of the alternative installation methods 
  below which simplify the installation of <mixer var="GAP"/> and its packages 
  by further automation or by offering precompiled binaries.
</p>

<h3>
  Homebrew
</h3>

<a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is the package manager for OS X. 
It has a formula to install <mixer var="GAP"/>, provided by Alexey Muranov. 
If you have installed Homebrew, for the new  <mixer var="GAP"/> installation 
you need to call these two commands:
<pre>
brew update
brew install homebrew/science/gap --with-packages
</pre>
To upgrade existing <mixer var="GAP"/> installation made with Homebrew, call 
<pre>
brew update
brew upgrade gap
</pre>
This may take some time, so please be patient.
