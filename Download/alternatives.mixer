<h2>
  Alternative <mixer var="GAP"/> distributions
</h2>

<p>
  To obtain a fully functional <mixer var="GAP"/> installation 
  you need not only to compile the core system, but also some of its 
  packages. If you install <mixer var="GAP"/>  as described on the page 
  <a href="/Download/index.html">Downloading&nbsp;and&nbsp;Installing&nbsp;<mixer var="GAP4"/></a>,
  then after compiling the core <mixer var="GAP"/> system you have to run in the 
  <code>pkg</code> subdirectory the shell script <code>../bin/BuildPackages.sh</code>
  in order to build most of the packages that require compilation provided 
  sufficiently many libraries, headers and tools are available.
</p>

<p>
  You might want to consider one of the alternative installation methods
  below which simplify the installation of <mixer var="GAP"/> and its packages
  by further automation or by offering precompiled binaries. Please note that
  these alternatives may not provide access to the latest public <mixer var="GAP"/>
  release, and it may take a while until they will be updated.
</p>

<h3>
  Docker
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker">Docker</a> is a virtualisation
software. There is a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/gapsystem/gap-docker/">
prebuilt Docker image for <mixer var="GAP"/> and most of the packages</a>, provided by 
Sebastian Gutsche, Alexander Konovalov and Sarah Mount. It contains additional 
software, used by some <mixer var="GAP"/> packages, including Ubuntu packages 
libmpfr-dev, libmpfi-dev libmpc-dev libfplll-dev (needed by the Float package),
PARI/GP, Polymake, Singular and 4ti2.

If you have installed Docker, first you need to download the <mixer var="GAP"/> 
container using
<pre>
docker pull gapsystem/gap-docker
</pre>
After that, you may just type
<pre>
docker run --rm -i -t gapsystem/gap-docker gap
</pre>
to start <mixer var="GAP"/>. Note that you may have to run it with sudo,
particularly if you are on Ubuntu. Further instructions could be found
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/gapsystem/gap-docker/">here</a>.

<h3>
  Gap.app (macOS only)
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/">Gap.app</a> is a native macOS frontend
and distribution of <mixer var="GAP"/>, developed by Russ Woodroofe.  The "Gap.app + GAP" edition
includes a fairly complete copy of <mixer var="GAP"/>, and can be installed by simply downloading a
disk image and dragging Gap.app to the Applications folder.  You can also install the built-in
<mixer var="GAP"/> for use from your usual terminal via the Install GAP Command For Shell menu option
(found under the Gap menu in the GUI frontend).
</p>
<p>The included <mixer var="GAP"/> comes with working copies of most of the packages in the
standard <mixer var="GAP"/> distribution.  Gap.app is compatible with 
<a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/xgap/">XGAP</a>, and allows interactive display
of subgroup lattices with the <code>GraphicSubgroupLattice</code> command. 
The version of <mixer var="GAP"/> that comes with Gap.app may lag slightly behind the very latest.
Full details on the currently included <mixer var="GAP"/> may be found in the 
  <a href="https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/faq.html#gapversioninfo">Gap.app FAQ</a>.
