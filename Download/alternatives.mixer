<h2>
  Alternative <mixer var="GAP"/> distributions
</h2>

<p>
  To obtain a fully functional <mixer var="GAP"/> installation 
  you need not only to compile the core system, but also some of its 
  packages. If you install <mixer var="GAP"/>  as described on the page 
  <a href="/Download/index.html">Downloading&nbsp;and&nbsp;Installing&nbsp;<mixer var="GAP4"/></a>,
  then after compiling the core <mixer var="GAP"/> system you have to run in the 
  <code>pkg</code> subdirectory the shell script <code>../bin/BuildPackages.sh</code>
  in order to build most of the packages that require compilation provided 
  sufficiently many libraries, headers and tools are available.
</p>

<p>
  You might want to consider one of the alternative installation methods
  below which simplify the installation of <mixer var="GAP"/> and its packages
  by further automation or by offering precompiled binaries. Please note that
  these alternatives may not provide access to the latest public <mixer var="GAP"/>
  release, and it may take a while until they will be updated.
</p>

<h3>
  Docker
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker">Docker</a> is a virtualisation
software. There is a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/gapsystem/gap-docker/">
prebuilt Docker image for <mixer var="GAP"/> and most of the packages</a>, provided by 
Sebastian Gutsche, Alexander Konovalov and Sarah Mount. It contains additional 
software, used by some <mixer var="GAP"/> packages, including Ubuntu packages 
libmpfr-dev, libmpfi-dev libmpc-dev libfplll-dev (needed by the Float package),
PARI/GP, Polymake, Singular and 4ti2.

If you have installed Docker, first you need to download the <mixer var="GAP"/> 
container using
<pre>
docker pull gapsystem/gap-docker
</pre>
After that, you may just type
<pre>
docker run --rm -i -t gapsystem/gap-docker gap
</pre>
to start <mixer var="GAP"/>. Note that you may have to run it with sudo,
particularly if you are on Ubuntu. Further instructions could be found
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/gapsystem/gap-docker/">here</a>.

<h3>
  Gap.app (macOS only)
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/">Gap.app</a> is a native macOS frontend
and distribution of GAP, developed by Russ Woodroofe.  The Gapdotapp+GAP edition
includes a full copy of GAP, which can be installed by simply downloading a disk
image, and dragging Gap.app to the Applications folder.  You can also install the
it for use in Terminal.app via the Install GAP Command For Shell menu option
(found under the Gap menu in the GUI frontend).
</p>
<p>The included GAP comes with working copies of most of the packages in the
standard GAP distribution.  It may lag slightly behind the very latest GAP version.
Full details on the currently-included GAP may be found in the 
  <a href="https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/faq.html#gapversioninfo">Gap.app FAQ</a>.
