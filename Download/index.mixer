<h4>Upgrading or New Installation?</h4>

<p>
If you have any version of <mixer var="GAP"/> older than
<mixer var="GAP"/> 4<mixer var="rel4long"/>.<mixer var="fix4level"/>,
the only way to install <mixer var="GAP"/> 4<mixer var="rel4long"/>.<mixer var="fix4level"/>
is a new installation.
</p>

<p>
If you already have <mixer var="GAP"/> 4<mixer var="rel4long"/>.<mixer var="fix4level"/> installed 
with the <a href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/gap/rsync">rsync binary installer</a> 
then all you need to do to upgrade is to call the <code>gapsync</code> script which was created 
during installation. This script will update both the core system and packages to their latest versions.
</p>

<p>
If you installed <mixer var="GAP"/> 4<mixer var="rel4long"/>.<mixer var="fix4level"/>
from the standard distribution and have not manually installed additional or 
updated packages in your <mixer var="GAP"/> distribution (which is no
longer necessary -- instead we recommend that you 
install them in the 
<mixer manual="Reference: GAP Root Directories">user specific GAP root directory</mixer>) 
then you can always upgrade to the latest version of GAP by moving the old version aside 
and downloading and installing the current archives, and this is the approach we recommend 
for most users. Make sure that you update any scripts or links to refer to the new version.
</p>

<p>
If you have limited bandwidth, or have customised your installation, you may be able to 
<a href="upgrade.html">upgrade your <mixer var="GAP"/> 4<mixer var="rel4long"/>.<mixer var="fix4level"/>
installation in place</a> with a smaller download. 
</p>


<h4><a name="requirements">Supported Operating Systems</a></h4>

<p>
We test <mixer var="GAP"/> on various versions of Linux and on some recent versions of Windows 
and Mac OS X in both 32- and 64-bit modes. You can install it on any of these systems using the 
standard distribution archives, although details of the process may vary. In addition, we offer 
<a href="index.html#alternatives">special installers</a> for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
To build <mixer var="GAP"/> from source you will need <a href="tools.html">some tools</a> 
installed. <mixer var="GAP"/> may compile and work for you on other systems, and if so we would 
be interested to know about it. 
</p>

<h4>License and Copyright</h4>

<p>The main archives contain the current release of <mixer var="GAP"/>.
    They also contain a number of contributed packages, found in the
    subdirectories <code>pkg</code> and <code>small</code> of the main
    distribution directory. The core part of the  <mixer var="GAP"/> 
    system is distributed under the terms of the GNU Public
    License (<a href="copyright.html">details</a> are given on a separate page),
    packages may have other licenses.
The copyright (C) (1987--<mixer var="relyear"/>) for the core part of the 
<mixer var="GAP"/> distribution is by the <mixer var="GAP"/> Group.
The copyright of redistributed packages remains with their authors.
</p>

<h3>The Basic Steps of a <mixer var="GAP"/> Installation</h3>

Note that to obtain a fully functional GAP installation you need not only
to compile the core system, but also some of its packages. You might want
to consider one of the <a href="#alternatives">alternative installation methods</a> below which
achieve this for you automatically. Otherwise, to install <mixer var="GAP"/> 
using the source distribution, perform the following steps:

<ul>
<li>Choose your preferred archive format and <a href="#Download">download</a> 
the corresponding archive.</li>
<li>Unpack the archive.</li>
<li>On UNIX, Linux or Mac OS X: compile the <mixer var="GAP"/> core system.</li>
<li>On UNIX, Linux or Mac OS X: change to the <code>pkg</code> subdirectory and call
<code>../bin/BuildPackages.sh</code> to run the script which will build most of
the packages that require compilation (provided sufficiently many libraries, headers
and tools are available).</li>
<li>On Windows: no compilation is needed, compiled executables for <mixer var="GAP"/> 
and some packages are already in the win.zip-archive.</li>
<li>Adjust some links/scripts/icons ..., depending on your system, to
make the new version of <mixer var="GAP"/> available to the users of
your machine.</li>
<li>Optional: run a few tests.</li>
</ul>

<a name="alternatives"></a>
<p><strong>Alternative Installation Methods.</strong></p>

<p>The following alternative installation methods offer simpler
  installation for many users by supplying precompiled binaries and
  support for the installation process.</p>

<ul>
<li> 
<mixer person="Frank Luebeck" data="name_link"/> offers a 
<a href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/gap/rsync">
Linux&nbsp;binary&nbsp;distribution</a> via remote syncronization with a
reference installation which includes all packages and some optimisations.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/index.html">Max
Neunh&ouml;ffer</a> offers 
<a href="https://gap-system.github.io/bob/">
BOB - a tool to download and build GAP and its packages from source</a> 
for Linux and Mac OS X.
You only download BOB who does all the rest for you. You need
a C-compiler and some libraries installed on your system but BOB will
tell you exactly what is missing.
</li>
<li>
<mixer person="Alexander Konovalov" data="name_link"/> offers an
<a href="https://www.gap-system.org/ukrgap/wininst/">
<mixer var="GAP"/>&nbsp;Installer&nbsp;for&nbsp;Windows</a>
with the same content as the win.zip archive above.
It provides a standard installation procedure that will guide you 
through all steps of the installation process.
</li>
<!--
<li>
<mixer person="Alexander Hulpke" data="name_link"/> offers a
Vista or XP 
<a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~hulpke/CGT/education.html">
<mixer var="GAP"/>&nbsp;Installer&nbsp;for&nbsp;Windows</a>.
</li>
-->
</ul> 


<!--
<p><strong>Debian packages.</strong>
Most <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>-based
GNU/Linux distributions contain
<code>.deb</code>-packages with the core part of GAP and a small number of
the  GAP packages
(note that after an update or new release of GAP it takes some time until these
Linux distributions are updated to the newest GAP version).
</p>
-->

<h3>Download Archives<a name="Download"></a></h3>

<p>
Links to the latest archives in four <a href="formats.html">formats</a>
(.tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .zip and -win.zip) 
can be found on the <a href="../Releases/index.html">Downloads</a> page.
If you use Unix or Mac OS X, you can use the .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 or .zip
archives. If you use Windows, then use the -win.zip archive. 
</p>
<p>
You can also download directly via <a href="alternatives.html">ftp</a>.
</p>

<h3>Unpacking and Installing the Archives</h3>

<p>
The installation procedure depends on the operating system you are using. 
Full instructions for installation on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X are 
available in a <a href="INSTALL">separate document</a>.
</p>


<h3>Testing the Installation<a name="Test"></a></h3>

<p>For a quick test of your installation you may start <mixer var="GAP"/>.
Normally, you will see a <mixer var="GAP"/>&nbsp;4 banner and the information about loaded 
components and packages. This information may vary depending 
on  your installation.  For  example,  for  the complete installation of 
latest versions of all packages you will have something like:

You should start GAP4 using `gap -A -x 80 -r -m 100m -o 512m'.
The more GAP4stones you get, the faster your system is.
The runtime of the following tests (in general) increases.
You should expect the test to take about one minute and show about
100000 GAP4stones on an Intel Core 2 Duo / 2.53 GHz machine.
The `next' time is an approximation of the running time for the next file.
