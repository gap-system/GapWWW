<h2>
  Alternative GAP distributions
</h2>

<p>
  To obtain a fully functional GAP installation 
  you need not only to compile the core system, but also some of its 
  packages. If you install GAP  as described on the page 
  <a href="/Download/index.html">Downloading&nbsp;and&nbsp;Installing&nbsp;GAP&nbsp;4</a>,
  then after compiling the core GAP system you have to run in the 
  <code>pkg</code> subdirectory the shell script <code>../bin/BuildPackages.sh</code>
  in order to build most of the packages that require compilation provided 
  sufficiently many libraries, headers and tools are available.
</p>

<p>
  You might want to consider one of the alternative installation methods
  below which simplify the installation of GAP and its packages
  by further automation or by offering precompiled binaries. Please note that
  these alternatives may not provide access to the latest public GAP
  release, and it may take a while until they will be updated.
</p>

<h3>
  Homebrew
</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is the package manager for macOS.
If you use Homebrew, you can install GAP using the
<a href="https://github.com/gap-system/homebrew-gap">GAP Homebrew tap</a>.
</p>

<h3>
  Docker
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker">Docker</a> is a virtualisation
software. There is a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/gapsystem/gap-docker/">
prebuilt Docker image for GAP and most of the packages</a>, provided by 
Sebastian Gutsche, Alexander Konovalov and Sarah Mount. It contains additional 
software, used by some GAP packages, including Ubuntu packages 
libmpfr-dev, libmpfi-dev libmpc-dev libfplll-dev (needed by the Float package),
PARI/GP, Polymake, Singular and 4ti2.

If you have installed Docker, first you need to download the GAP 
container using
<pre>
docker pull gapsystem/gap-docker
</pre>
After that, you may just type
<pre>
docker run --rm -i -t gapsystem/gap-docker gap
</pre>
to start GAP. Note that you may have to run it with sudo,
particularly if you are on Ubuntu. Further instructions could be found
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/gapsystem/gap-docker/">here</a>.
</p>
  
<h3>
  Gap.app (macOS only)
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/">Gap.app</a> is a native macOS frontend
and distribution of GAP, developed by Russ Woodroofe.  The "Gap.app + GAP" edition
includes a fairly complete copy of GAP, and can be installed by simply downloading a
disk image and dragging Gap.app to the Applications folder.  You can also install the built-in
GAP for use from your usual terminal via the Install GAP Command For Shell menu option
(found under the Gap menu in the GUI frontend).
</p>
<p>The included GAP comes with working copies of most of the packages in the
standard GAP distribution.  Gap.app is compatible with 
<a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/xgap/">XGAP</a>, and allows interactive display
of subgroup lattices with the <code>GraphicSubgroupLattice</code> command. 
The version of GAP that comes with Gap.app may lag slightly behind the very latest.
Full details on the currently included GAP may be found in the 
  <a href="https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/faq.html#gapversioninfo">Gap.app FAQ</a>.

<h3>
  Debian Packages
</h3>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> GNU/Linux distribution
  contains <code>.deb</code>-packages with the core part of
  GAP and some of the GAP packages
  (currently GAP4.4.4 in the stable
distribution whereas GAP4.4.9 is only in the 
<i>unstable</i> branch).
</p>

<h2>
  Trying GAP online
</h2>

<p>
  You can try GAP in a
  <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebook running on
  <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a>, 
  following instructions from the README file in 
  <a href="https://github.com/gap-system/try-gap-in-jupyter">this repository</a>.
</p>


<p>
  It is also possible to use GAP via a free account on
  <a href="https://cocalc.com/">CoCalc</a> (formerly SageMathCloud).
  The combination of GAP packages available there may differ from
  the one from the official GAP distribution; however, the maintainers
  of CoCalc would love to hear about any additional packages you
  would like to be installed or any questions you might have
  (email <a href="mailto:help@cocalc.com">help@cocalc.com</a>).

<h3>
  BOB
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://gap-system.github.io/bob/">BOB</a> is a tool developed by
<a href="http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/index.html">Max Neunh&ouml;ffer</a>
to download and build GAP and its packages from source on Linux and OS X.
It required a C-compiler and some libraries installed on the system, and was able to
tell exactly which dependencies were missing. The last GAP release provided
by BOB was GAP 4.7.9.
</p>

<h3>
  GAP Rsync
</h3>
<p>
{% include namelink.html name="Frank LÃ¼beck" %} has been offering a
<a href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/gap/rsync">Linux
binary distribution</a> via remote syncronization with a reference
installation which includes all packages and some optimisations.
The last GAP release provided by this service was GAP 4.7.6.
