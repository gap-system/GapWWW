<h3>The Basic Steps of a GAP Installation</h3>

<p>
Note that to obtain a fully functional GAP installation you need not only to 
compile the core system, but also some of its packages. You might want to consider 
one of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Download/alternatives.html">alternative installation methods</a>
which achieve this for you automatically. Otherwise, to install 
GAP using the source distribution, perform the following steps:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Verify that <a href="tools.html">all required tools</a> are installed.</li>
<li>Choose your preferred archive format and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Releases/{{site.data.release.version}}.html">download</a> 
the corresponding archive.</li>
<li>Unpack the archive.</li>
<li>On UNIX, Linux or macOS: compile the GAP core system
by running <code>./configure; make</code> in the unpacked directory.</li>
<li>On UNIX, Linux or macOS: change to the <code>pkg</code> subdirectory and call
<code>../bin/BuildPackages.sh</code> to run the script which will build most of
the packages that require compilation (provided sufficiently many libraries, headers
and tools are available). If something doesn't work on your system, please
refer to the <code>README</code> file provided with the corresponding package. 
</li>
<li>On Windows: no compilation is needed, since compiled executables for GAP 
and some packages are already provided by the <code>.exe</code> installer or
<code>-win.zip</code> archive.</li>
<li>Adjust some links/scripts/icons etc., depending on your system, to
make the new version of GAP available to the users of
your machine.</li>
<li>Optional: run a few tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For detailed installation instructions for the GAP source
distribution on UNIX (which includes Linux), macOS, and on Windows
see the <code>INSTALL.md</code> file, 
which may be found in the GAP root directory after 
unpacking the archive with the GAP distribution.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Optional:</strong>
GAP starts up much faster using a so called <i>workspace</i>.
A workspace can be generated and used as shown in 
the script <a href="CreateWorkspace.sh"><code>CreateWorkspace.sh</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that the <code>CreateWorkspace.sh</code> script may require
<code>chmod&nbsp;+x&nbsp;CreateWorkspace.sh</code> first.
</p>
