<p>
If you have any version of GAP older than the
<a href="/Releases/{{site.data.gap.relversion}}.html">most recent public release</a>,
the only way to install a new version of GAP
is a <a href="index.html">new installation</a>.
</p>

<h4><a name="upgpkg"></a>Upgrading and Installing New Packages</h4>

<p>
If you have the most recent version of GAP, then it may
happen that some packages were upgraded since the GAP
release was made, because packages are released and upgraded
individually and independently of the core GAP system.
</p>

<p>
There are several possibilities to get new versions of these packages.
</p>

<p> 
One of them is to wait until the next GAP release will
be published. Its distribution will contain all latest versions of
packages redistributed with GAP, tested for the
compatibility with the new release and all other redistributed with
GAPGAP packages. You will have to
repeat the full installation following
instructions for a <a href="index.html">new installation</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you wish only to install new versions of selected packages case
by case, without changing other parts of your GAP 
installation, you need to retrieve individual package archives which are 
accessible via the <a href="../Packages/packages.html">package overview</a>.
</p>

<p>
We recommend to install new versions of individual packages
(and also to keep your ``private'' packages which are not redistributed 
with GAP) in your user specific GAP root directory. 
The name of this user specific directory depends on your operating system 
and can be found in <code>GAPInfo.UserGapRoot</code> (see 
{% include ref.html manual="Reference: GAP Root Directories" text="GAP Root Directories" %}).
This way you will not keep your personal files in the main GAP 
root directory and will be able to upgrade GAP straightforwardly after the
new release without a risk of your customisations being lost.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you have used one of the 
<a href="/Download/alternatives.html">alternative installation methods</a>
to install GAP, then you should check their update 
instructions to find out how to update your installation.
