<h2>Upgrading packages for the current release
<mixer var="GAP"/> 4<mixer var="rel4long"/>.<mixer var="fix4level"/></h2>

<p>
This page describes how to update <mixer var="GAP"/> packages in an 
existing installation of 
<mixer var="GAP"/> 4<mixer var="rel4long"/>.<mixer var="fix4level"/>.
</p>

<p>
If you have any version of <mixer var="GAP"/> older than
<mixer var="GAP"/> 4<mixer var="rel4long"/>.<mixer var="fix4level"/>,
the only way to install <mixer var="GAP"/> 4<mixer var="rel4long"/>.<mixer var="fix4level"/>
is a new installation.
</p>

<p>
If you have the most recent version 
<mixer var="GAP"/> 4<mixer var="rel4long"/>.<mixer var="fix4level"/>,
then it may happen that some packages were upgraded since the time
your installation was made, since packages are released and upgraded 
individually and independently of the core part of <mixer var="GAP"/>. 
</p>

<p>
We explain how to check this below.
</p>

<h4><a name="upg"></a>Checking if you need to upgrade</h4>
<p>
If you run  <mixer var="GAP"/> from your installation you can cut and
paste the following lines into that session, which produce suggestions 
for possible upgrades. This gives a list containing the names and
versions of the currently distributed <mixer var="GAP"/> core system and 
<mixer var="GAP"/> packages.
</p>

<pre>
   SuggestUpgrades([<mixer parsevar="PKG_SuggestUpgradeLines"/>      ]);
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, if you are connected to the Internet, 
you may call the function <code>CheckForUpdates</code>
provided by the IO package which will call 
<code>SuggestUpgrades</code> with the right arguments 
automatically.
</p>

<h4><a name="upgpkg"></a>Upgrading and Installing New Packages</h4>

<p>
If the procedure described above suggests upgrades, there are several
possibilities. 
</p>

<p> 
One of them is to get the current archive of
<mixer var="GAP"/> 4<mixer var="rel4long"/>.<mixer var="fix4level"/> 
which will contain all latest versions of packages redistributed
with <mixer var="GAP"/> and repeat the full installation following 
instructions for a <a href="index.html">new installation</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you wish only to install new versions of selected packages case
by case, without changing other parts of your <mixer var="GAP"/> 
installation, you need to retrieve individual package archives which are 
accessible via the <a href="../Packages/packages.html">package overview</a>.
</p>

<p>
We recommend to install new versions of individual packages
(and also to keep your ``private'' packages which are not redistributed 
with GAP) in your user specific <mixer var="GAP"/> root directory. 
The name of this user specific directory depends on your operating system 
and can be found in <code>GAPInfo.UserGapRoot</code> (see 
<mixer manual="Reference: GAP Root Directories">GAP Root Directories</mixer>).
This way you will not keep your personal files in the main <mixer var="GAP"/> 
root directory and will be able to upgrade GAP straightforwardly after the
new release without a risk of your customisations being lost.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you have used one of the 
<a href="index.html#alternatives">alternative installation methods</a>
to install <mixer var="GAP"/>, then you should check their update 
instructions to find out how to update your installation.
