If you have any version of <mixer var="GAP"/> older than the
<a href="/Releases/index.html">most recent public release</a>,
the only way to install a new version of <mixer var="GAP"/>
is a <a href="index.html">new installation</a>.
</p>

<h4><a name="upgpkg"></a>Upgrading and Installing New Packages</h4>

<p>
If you have the most recent version of <mixer var="GAP"/>, then it may
happen that some packages were upgraded since the <mixer var="GAP"/>
release was made, because packages are released and upgraded
individually and independently of the core <mixer var="GAP"/> system.
</p>

<p>
There are several possibilities to get new versions of these packages.
</p>

<p> 
One of them is to wait until the next <mixer var="GAP"/> release will
be published. Its distribution will contain all latest versions of
packages redistributed with <mixer var="GAP"/>, tested for the
compatibility with the new release and all other redistributed with
<mixer var="GAP"/><mixer var="GAP"/> packages. You will have to
repeat the full installation following
instructions for a <a href="index.html">new installation</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you wish only to install new versions of selected packages case
by case, without changing other parts of your <mixer var="GAP"/> 
installation, you need to retrieve individual package archives which are 
accessible via the <a href="../Packages/packages.html">package overview</a>.
</p>

<p>
We recommend to install new versions of individual packages
(and also to keep your ``private'' packages which are not redistributed 
with GAP) in your user specific <mixer var="GAP"/> root directory. 
The name of this user specific directory depends on your operating system 
and can be found in <code>GAPInfo.UserGapRoot</code> (see 
<mixer manual="Reference: GAP Root Directories">GAP Root Directories</mixer>).
This way you will not keep your personal files in the main <mixer var="GAP"/> 
root directory and will be able to upgrade GAP straightforwardly after the
new release without a risk of your customisations being lost.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you have used one of the 
<a href="/Download/alternatives.html">alternative installation methods</a>
to install <mixer var="GAP"/>, then you should check their update 
instructions to find out how to update your installation.
</p>

<h4>Checking if you need to upgrade</h4>

<p>
If you run <mixer var="GAP"/> from your installation you can copy and
paste the following lines into that session to produce suggestions 
for possible upgrades. In particular, this will produce a list all packages
having redistributed with <mixer var="GAP"/> versions newer than those in
your installation.
</p>
<p>
Note that if you have any version of <mixer var="GAP"/> older than the
<a href="/Releases/index.html">most recent public release</a>,
the only way to install a new version of <mixer var="GAP"/>
is a <a href="index.html">new installation</a>.
