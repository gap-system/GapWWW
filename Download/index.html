<p class="center">
The current version is 
<a href="/Releases/{{site.data.gap.relversion}}.html">GAP&nbsp;{{site.data.gap.relversion}}</a> 
released on {{site.data.gap.reldate}}.
</p>

<h4>Upgrading or New Installation?</h4>

<p>
If you have any version of GAP older than the
<a href="/Releases/{{site.data.gap.relversion}}.html">current version</a>,
the only way to install a new version of GAP
is a new installation.
</p>

<p>
If you installed GAP 
from the standard distribution and have not manually installed additional or 
updated packages in your GAP distribution (which is no
longer necessary -- instead we recommend that you 
install them in the 
{% include ref.html manual="Reference: GAP Root Directories" text="user specific GAP root directory" %}) 
then you can always upgrade to the latest version of GAP by moving the old version aside 
and downloading and installing the current archives, and this is the approach we recommend 
for most users. Make sure that you update any scripts or links to refer to the new version.
</p>


<h4><a name="requirements">Supported Operating Systems</a></h4>

<p>
We test GAP on various versions of Linux and on some recent versions of Windows 
and macOS in both 32- and 64-bit modes. You can install it on any of these systems using the 
standard distribution archives, although details of the process may vary. In addition, there
some <a href="/Download/alternatives.html">alternative installation methods</a> for Linux, macOS and Windows.
To build GAP from source you will need <a href="tools.html">some tools</a> 
installed. GAP may compile and work for you on other systems, and if so we would 
be interested to know about it. 
</p>

<h4>License and Copyright</h4>

<p>The main archives contain the current release of GAP.
    They also contain a number of contributed packages, found in the
    <code>pkg</code> subdirectory of the main
    distribution directory. The core part of the  GAP 
    system is distributed under the terms of the GNU Public
    License (<a href="copyright.html">details</a> are given on a separate page),
    packages may have other licenses.
The copyright (C) (1987--{{site.data.gap.relyear}}) for the core part of the 
GAP distribution is by the GAP Group.
The copyright of redistributed packages remains with their authors.
</p>

<h3>The Basic Steps of a GAP Installation</h3>

<p>
Note that to obtain a fully functional GAP installation you need not only to 
compile the core system, but also some of its packages. You might want to consider 
one of the <a href="/Download/alternatives.html">alternative installation methods</a>
which achieve this for you automatically. Otherwise, to install 
GAP using the source distribution, perform the following steps:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose your preferred archive format and <a href="/Releases/{{site.data.gap.relversion}}.html">download</a> 
the corresponding archive.</li>
<li>Unpack the archive.</li>
<li>On UNIX, Linux or macOS: compile the GAP core system
by running <code>./configure; make</code> in the unpacked directory.</li>
<li>On UNIX, Linux or macOS: change to the <code>pkg</code> subdirectory and call
<code>../bin/BuildPackages.sh</code> to run the script which will build most of
the packages that require compilation (provided sufficiently many libraries, headers
and tools are available). If something doesn't work on your system, please
refer to the <code>README</code> file provided with the corresponding package. 
</li>
<li>On Windows: no compilation is needed, since compiled executables for GAP 
and some packages are already provided by the <code>.exe</code> installer or
<code>-win.zip</code> archive.</li>
<li>Adjust some links/scripts/icons etc., depending on your system, to
make the new version of GAP available to the users of
your machine.</li>
<li>Optional: run a few tests.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Download Archives<a name="Download"></a></h3>

<p>
Links to the latest archives in four <a href="formats.html">formats</a>
(.tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .zip and -win.zip) and an .exe Windows installer
can be found on the <a href="/Releases/{{site.data.gap.relversion}}.html">Downloads</a> page.
If you use Unix or macOS, you can use the .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 or .zip
archives. If you use Windows, then we strongly recommend to use the .exe
install, and use the -win.zip archives only when this is really necessary.
</p>

<h3>Unpacking and Installing the Archives</h3>

<p>
The installation procedure depends on the operating system you are using. 
Full instructions for installation on Windows, Linux and macOS are 
available in the <code>INSTALL.md</code> file, 
which may be found in the GAP root directory after 
unpacking the archive with the GAP distribution.
</p>


<h3>Testing the Installation<a name="Test"></a></h3>

<p>For a quick test of your installation you may start GAP.
Normally, you will see a GAP&nbsp;4 banner and the information about loaded 
components and packages. This information may vary depending 
on  your installation.  For  example,  for  the complete installation of 
latest versions of all packages you will have something like:
