## GAP logo contest results

Between GAP Days Summer 2024 (in August 2024) and GAP Days Spring 2025 (in April 2025)
we ran a contest to select the new GAP logo. You can see the result now on this
website.

We would like to thank the following people who participated and submitted so many different
and amazing designs:
**Aron Ban Szabo, Bilal Hasanat, Claudio Piedade, Cormullion, Dario Mathiae, David Joyner, Franziska Schiessl, Istvan Szollosi, Janika Peters, Jens Bossaert, John Chakkour, Max Horn, Reinis Cirpons, Roger Vogeler**.

## Origin of the Logo

The logo was designed by Max Horn, who gives this explanation for the
design rationale behind it.

> The diagram in the left part is meant to symbolize symmetry, here $S_3$
> acting on the vertices of a graph with four nodes, the action indicated by
> arrows suggesting involutions swapping the leaves. The graph can also be
> interpreted as the Dynkin diagram of type $D_4$, and then the group action
> is the triality automorphism which plays an important role in algebriac Lie
> theory, finite simple groups, geometry and more.
> 
> The letters GAP feature prominently and are arranged vertically. It is red,
> matching the color of the central node of the Dynkin diagram. The central node
> thus represents GAP and the outer nodes revolve around it
> 
> In addition, in the full logo we spell out what the abbreviation GAP stands
> for, to convey clearly what GAP is about.
> 
> The font in the logo is the [Ubuntu Font](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/). It
> is under a [liberal license](https://ubuntu.com/legal/font-licence) that is
> compatible with the open source spirit of the GAP project. Its design blurb
> states that it aims to "convey a precise, reliable and free attitude", which
> of course fits well with GAP.
