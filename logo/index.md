### Academic & Educational Use Waiver

For uses in **academic, educational, or research contexts**, attribution is **not required** if it is clear from context that the logo refers to the GAP computer algebra system. Examples include:

- Scientific posters or presentations referencing GAP.
- Slides, lectures, or demonstrations in courses at any level (high school, university, workshops).
- Publications, articles, or tutorials discussing or teaching GAP.

In these cases, **the context itself counts as sufficient attribution**. The main goal is to ensure it is clear the logo represents GAP.

## Origin of the Logo

The logo was designed by Max Horn, who gives this explanation for the
design rationale behind it.

> The diagram in the left part is meant to symbolize symmetry, here $S_3$
> acting on the vertices of a graph with four nodes, the action indicated by
> arrows suggesting involutions swapping the leaves. The graph can also be
> interpreted as the Dynkin diagram of type $D_4$, and then the group action
> is the triality automorphism which plays an important role in algebriac Lie
> theory, finite simple groups, geometry and more.
> 
> The letters GAP feature prominently and are arranged vertically. It is red,
> matching the color of the central node of the Dynkin diagram. The central node
> thus represents GAP and the outer nodes revolve around it
> 
> In addition, in the full logo we spell out what the abbreviation GAP stands
> for, to convey clearly what GAP is about.
> 
> The font in the logo is the [Ubuntu Font](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/). It
> is under a [liberal license](https://ubuntu.com/legal/font-licence) that is
> compatible with the open source spirit of the GAP project. Its design blurb
> states that it aims to "convey a precise, reliable and free attitude", which
> of course fits well with GAP.
