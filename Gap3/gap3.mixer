<h3>
  The <mixer var="GAP3"/> branch
</h3>
<p>
  From this page we start a separate branch of Web pages for the older
  version <mixer var="GAP3"/>.
  Please note that all pages of this <mixer var="GAP3"/> branch will still
  carry the top bar pointing to the main branches of the whole
  <mixer var="GAP"/> site. The <mixer var="GAP3"/> branch has main
  subbranches that are very similar to corresponding main branches of the
  <mixer var="GAP"/> site. However note that there are some pages referring
  to the whole <mixer var="GAP"/> project and these will not be duplicated
  in the <mixer var="GAP3"/> branch. You find the main subbranches of the
  <mixer var="GAP3"/> branch as 'children' of the <mixer var="GAP3"/> page
  in the left navigator bar.

<h3>
  Development of <mixer var="GAP3"/>
</h3>
<p>
  <mixer var="GAP3"/> was started at
  <a href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/LDFM/">
  Lehrstuhl&nbsp;D&nbsp;f√ºr&nbsp;Mathematik</a> of RWTH Aachen in 1986 and
  further developed there. Since 1997 it has been maintained from
  <a href="https://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/">St&nbsp;Andrews</a>.
</p>

<h3>
  User Contributions to <mixer var="GAP3"/>
</h3>
<p>
  Over the years several pieces of code and data for <mixer var="GAP3"/> have
  been made available by users of <mixer var="GAP3"/> to other users. These
  fall into three categories which we list on different Web pages.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="Packages3/packages.html">
  <mixer var="GAP3"/>&nbsp;Share&nbsp;Packages</a>:
  Since 1992 a set of user contributed programs has been given the status of
  'share packages' if it was thought to represent a piece of work equivalent
  to a sizeable mathematical publication.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="Datalib3/datalib.html">
  <mixer var="GAP3"/>&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Libraries</a>:
  <mixer var="GAP3"/> also contains many 'data libraries' which we list on
  a separate page with a brief characterisation of their contents.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="Contrib3/contrib.html">
  <mixer var="GAP3"/>&nbsp;Deposited&nbsp;Contributions</a>:
  Finally there are several pieces of code, listed on a third page as
  'deposited contributions' which have in no way been checked by the
  <mixer var="GAP"/> team.
</p>
<p>
  There are similar lists of user contributions for <mixer var="GAP4"/>.
  Note, however, that terminology has changed: What is called 'share package'
  here is simply called 'package' with <mixer var="GAP4"/>. Also note that even
  where packages, data libraries or deposited contributions for
  <mixer var="GAP3"/> and <mixer var="GAP4"/> have the same or similar
  names their contents may differ considerably.
