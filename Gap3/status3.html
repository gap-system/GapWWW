<p>
  We strongly suggest that, whenever possible, you use GAP&nbsp;4
  rather than GAP&nbsp;3.
  GAP&nbsp;4 offers by far more facilities and much more
  mathematical functionality in its main library.
  Some differences are explained on the page
  <a href="/Gap3/Changes3/changes.html">
  GAP&nbsp;3&nbsp;to&nbsp;GAP&nbsp;4</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The last release of GAP&nbsp;3 was 3.4.4 which was announced
  in the
  <a href="/Contacts/Forum/forum.html">GAP&nbsp;Forum</a>
  on April 22, 1997. GAP&nbsp;3 was frozen in May 2000 with
  bugfix 13 and will not be developed any further. We are still making it
  available because not only may there still be some users having private
  programs written in GAP&nbsp;3, but also not all funtionality
  available through GAP&nbsp;3 has yet been transferred to
  GAP&nbsp;4. This is in particular true for some user contributions
  to GAP&nbsp;3 such as the 'share packages' CHEVIE, matrix, and
  some quotient algorithms.

<h3>
  Changing from GAP&nbsp;3 to GAP&nbsp;4
</h3>
<p>
  If you still have private programs written in GAP&nbsp;3 the
  functionality of which you would like to have in GAP&nbsp;4 it
  may be the best idea to rewrite them from scratch. However, at the time
  of the introduction of GAP&nbsp;4 also some material was provided
  to help in migrating from GAP&nbsp;3 to GAP&nbsp;4. See
  <a href="/Gap3/Changes3/changes.html">
  GAP&nbsp;3&nbsp;to&nbsp;GAP&nbsp;4</a> and the document
  <a href="migratedoc.pdf">Migrating&nbsp;to&nbsp;GAP&nbsp;4</a>.

  How to cite GAP&nbsp;3

  If you use GAP&nbsp;3 in work that leads to a publication, please
  <a href="cite3.html">cite&nbsp;it</a>.
