<p>
  There is a lot of written material explaining the functionality and use
  of GAP&nbsp;3 and providing information about algorithmic
  background.

<h3>
  GAP&nbsp;3 Manuals
</h3>
<p>
  We provide an extensive
  <a href="manual.html">GAP&nbsp;3&nbsp;Manual</a> (of 1571 pages).
  Its first chapter
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Gap3/Manual3/C001S000.htm">About&nbsp;GAP</a> is an
  introduction to GAP&nbsp;3. Chapters 2 to 55 constitute the
  reference manual of the main GAP&nbsp;3 library while chapters
  56 to 86 provide manuals for the
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Gap3/Packages3/packages.html">
  GAP&nbsp;3&nbsp;Share&nbsp;Packages</a> which can also be
  accessed from that list. The description of most functions is
  accompanied by examples of their use.
</p>

<h3>
  Examples
</h3>
<p>
  Some examples of the use of GAP&nbsp;3 from papers and talks,
  contributed by different authors, have been worked out in detail and
  are listed on a page
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Gap3/Doc3/Examples3/examples.html">
  GAP&nbsp;3&nbsp;Examples</a>.
  Of course, the examples of this list cover only a small part of the
  functionality of GAP&nbsp;3.

<p>
  Note that the listings of the latter three sources do not distinguish
  between use of GAP&nbsp;3 and GAP&nbsp;4, you have to
  find out yourself which one is used. 
</p>
<p>
  We ask you to help us to keep the bibliography up to
  date by sending us the bibliographical data of your own publications
  citing GAP. Please follow the advice given on the page
