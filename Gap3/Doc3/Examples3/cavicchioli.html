In research on some fundamental groups, A. Cavicchioli (Modena)
considered a family of groups defined by the presentations<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ G = \langle a,b\mid aba^{-2}bab^{-1}
= a(b^{-1}a^3b^{-1}a^{-3})^q = 1 \rangle $.<br /><br />

We investigate the cases q=1 and q=2. These examples were first
described in pre-GAP terms in a
<a href="/Doc/Talks/talks.html#cavicchioli">paper</a>
'An elementary introduction to computational methods for finitely
presented groups'. The GAP&nbsp;3 code given below is adapted
from a <a href="/Doc/Talks/talks.html#rennes">talk</a> by
{% include namelink.html name="Alexander Hulpke" %}.

is also available.

<h3>
We first investigate the group h with the parameter q=1.
</h3>

We define the fp group h and its subgroup s generated by the first
generator.

<pre>
  gap&gt; f := FreeGroup(2); a:=f.1;; b:=f.2;;
  Group( f.1, f.2 )
  gap&gt; h := f/[a*b*a^-2*b*a*b^-1,(b^-1*a^3*b^-1*a^-3)^1*a];
  Group( f.1, f.2 )
  gap&gt; s := Subgroup(h,[h.1]);
  Subgroup( Group( f.1, f.2 ), [ f.1 ] )
</pre>

In order to see the working of the Todd-Coxeter method determining the
index of s in h we set a suitable print level.

<pre>
  gap&gt; InfoFpGroup1:=Print;; InfoFpGroup2:=Print;;
  gap&gt; Index(h,s);
  #I  CosetTableFpGroup called:
  #I      defined deleted alive   maximal
  #I	  13	  1	  12	  13
  12
</pre>

We determine the permutation representation of h on the cosets of s and
the order of that permutation group.

<pre>
  gap&gt; p := OperationCosetsFpGroup(h,s);
  Group( ( 2, 3, 5, 7, 9)( 4, 6, 8,10,11), ( 1, 2, 4, 6, 5)( 7, 9,11,12, 8) )
  gap&gt; Size(p);
  60
</pre>

Encouraged by the success we now look at the regular permutation
representation of h.

<pre>
  gap&gt; Index(h,TrivialSubgroup(h));
  #I  CosetTableFpGroup called:
  #I      defined deleted alive   maximal
  #I	  133	  13	  120	  133
  120
</pre>

Next we want to learn more about the structure of the group s the order of
which we know to be 120.

<pre>
  gap&gt; AbelianInvariants(h);
  [  ]
</pre>

So the group h is perfect and, in fact, isomorphic to SL(2,5).

<h3>
We next try the same procedure with the group g with the parameter q=2.
</h3>

<pre>
  gap&gt; g := f/[a*b*a^-2*b*a*b^-1,(b^-1*a^3*b^-1*a^-3)^2*a];
  Group( f.1, f.2 )
  gap&gt; Index(g,Subgroup(g,[g.1]));
</pre>

In the following output describing the performance of the Todd-Coxeter
method, which in this case does not succeed within the maximally allowed
64000 coset numbers, we leave out several lines in the printing below.

<pre>
  #I  CosetTableFpGroup called:
  #I      defined deleted alive   maximal
  #I	  999	  1	  998	  999
  #I	  1997	  3	  1994	  1996
  <b>. . .</b>

  #I	  62929	  71	  62858	  62889
  #I	  63927	  73	  63854	  63887
  Error, the coset enumeration has defined more than 64000 cosets:
  type 'return;' if you want to continue with a new limit of 128000 cosets,
  type 'quit;' if you want to quit the coset enumeration,
  type 'maxlimit := 0; return;' in order to continue without a limit,
   in
  CosetTableFpGroup( G, H ) called from
  G.operations.Index( G, U ) called from
  Index( g, Subgroup( g, [ g.1 ] ) ) called from
  main loop
  brk&gt; quit;
</pre>

Rather than continuing the enumeration with an increased limit we have
quitted it in order to try a different approach. We can now reset the print
level to reduce the output.

<pre>
  gap&gt; InfoFpGroup1:=Ignore;; InfoFpGroup2:=Ignore;;
</pre>

We first check that the group g is perfect.

<pre>
  gap&gt; AbelianInvariants(g);
  [  ]
</pre>

Next we determine all subgroups of g of index less than or equal to 15
and identify the type of the transitive permutation groups acting on their
cosets.

<pre>
  gap&gt; u := LowIndexSubgroupsFpGroup(g,TrivialSubgroup(g),15);;
  gap&gt; u := Filtered(u,i-&gt;Index(g,i)&gt;1);;
  gap&gt; list := List(u,i-&gt;OperationCosetsFpGroup(g,i));;
  gap&gt; Length(list);
  24
  gap&gt; id := List([1..24],
  &gt; i-&gt;[Index(g,u[i]),Size(list[i]),TransitiveIdentification(list[i])]);;
  gap&gt; Collected(id);
  [ [ [ 11, 660, 5 ], 2 ], [ [ 11, 19958400, 7 ], 8 ], [ [ 12, 660, 179 ], 1 ], 
    [ [ 12, 95040, 295 ], 4 ], [ [ 12, 239500800, 300 ], 3 ], 
    [ [ 13, 3113510400, 8 ], 6 ] ]
</pre>

We ensure that all these permutation groups are simple.

<pre>
  gap&gt; Collected(List(list,i-&gt;IsSimple(i)));
  [ [ true, 24 ] ]
</pre>

From the orders we therefore see that the occurring groups are isomorphic
to the alternating groups of degrees 11, 12, and 13, the group PSL(2,11),
and the Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>.
<br />
We now form the subdirect product sd of the permutation groups obtained
above and verify that this subdirect product is indeed a homomorphic image
of our given group g.

<pre>
  gap&gt; d := DirectProduct(list);;
  gap&gt; Sum(id,i-&gt;i[1]);
  284
  gap&gt; sd := Subgroup(d,[
  &gt; Product([1..24],i-&gt;d.generators[2*i-1]),
  &gt; Product([1..24],i-&gt;d.generators[2*i])]);;
  gap&gt; List(g.relators,i-&gt;MappedWord(i,g.generators,sd.generators));
  [ (), () ]
</pre>

The order of the subdirect product is huge.

<pre>
  gap&gt; Size(sd);
  187838840781137083803280175646550961040094223793955611966199644315614527534543\
  5097975617726355751505731109984424427520000000000000000000000000000000000000
</pre>

We hence suspect that the group g may be infinite. It is perfect,
but there is a chance that some of its subgroups may be not. So we determine
the types of the commutator factor groups of the subgroups we had found
before.

<pre>
  gap&gt; List(u,i-&gt;AbelianInvariants(i));
  [ [ 11, 13 ], [ 2, 3, 9 ], [ 11, 13 ], [ 11, 13 ], [ 11, 13 ], [ 0, 0, 2 ], 
    [ 2, 2, 8 ], [ 2, 3, 9 ], [ 11, 13 ], [ 2, 2, 8 ], [ 11, 13 ], [ 2, 2, 8 ], 
    [ 2, 2, 8 ], [ 2, 2, 8 ], [ 2, 2, 3 ], [ 2, 2, 3 ], [ 2, 2, 3 ], 
    [ 2, 2, 3 ], [ 2, 2, 3 ], [ 2, 2, 3 ], [ 2, 2, 3 ], [ 2, 2, 3 ], 
    [ 2, 2, 3 ], [ 2, 2, 3 ] ]
  gap&gt; quit;
</pre>

The sixth of these types is [ 0, 0, 2 ], telling us that indeed the
corresponding subgroup has an abelian factor group that is a direct product
of a free abelian group of rank 2 times a cyclic group of order 2.
