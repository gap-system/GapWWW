  As the <a href="/Doc/Bib/bib.html">Bibliography</a> shows,
  GAP has been used in a wide variety of areas of
  mathematics. These examples are intended to give some flavour of this.
  Needless to say such a list cannot be exhaustive.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="rubik.html">
    <b> Analyzing Rubik's Cube with GAP </b></a> <br />
    An example by {% include namelink.html name="Martin Sch√∂nert" %}, 1993.
    An almost classical permutation group of small degree is examined
    with some elementary GAP&nbsp;3 commands.
    <br />&nbsp;

  <li>
    <a href="cavicchioli.html">
    <b> Two fundamental groups from A. Cavicchioli </b></a> <br />
    This example demonstrates some methods for the investigation of finitely
    presented groups using two presentations of fundamental groups due to
    A. Cavicchioli.

  <li>
    <a href="higman.html">
    <b> Constructing the Higman-Sims group from the number 23 </b></a> <br />
    An example presented by {% include namelink.html name="Alexander Hulpke" %}
    in the software demonstration at the 16th British Combinatorial
    Conference in London, July 1997.
    <br />&nbsp;
  </li> 

  <li>
    <a href="co3.html">
    <b>Constructing Co3</b></a> <br />
    This is an extended version of the last example in the paper
    "<em>Construction of Co3. An example of the use of an integrated system
    for Computational Group Theory</em>", Groups St Andrews 1997 in Bath,
    by {% include namelink.html name="Alexander Hulpke" %} and
    {% include namelink.html name="Steve Linton" %}.
