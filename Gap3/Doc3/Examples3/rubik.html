This is an example by {% include namelink.html name="Martin Sch√∂nert" %},
1993. An almost classical permutation group of small degree is examined
with some elementary GAP&nbsp;3 commands. The associated
GAP&nbsp;3 <a href="rubik.in">input&nbsp;file</a> is also available.

For the example we consider the group of transformations of Rubik's magic
cube. If we number the faces of this cube as follows

</pre>
<p>
then the group is generated by the following generators, corresponding to
the six faces of the cube (the two semicolons tell GAP not
to print the result, which is identical to the input here).
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; cube := Group(
  &gt; ( 1, 3, 8, 6)( 2, 5, 7, 4)( 9,33,25,17)(10,34,26,18)(11,35,27,19),
  &gt; ( 9,11,16,14)(10,13,15,12)( 1,17,41,40)( 4,20,44,37)( 6,22,46,35),
  &gt; (17,19,24,22)(18,21,23,20)( 6,25,43,16)( 7,28,42,13)( 8,30,41,11),
  &gt; (25,27,32,30)(26,29,31,28)( 3,38,43,19)( 5,36,45,21)( 8,33,48,24),
  &gt; (33,35,40,38)(34,37,39,36)( 3, 9,46,32)( 2,12,47,29)( 1,14,48,27),
  &gt; (41,43,48,46)(42,45,47,44)(14,22,30,38)(15,23,31,39)(16,24,32,40) );;
</pre>
<p>
First we want to know the size of this group.
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; Size( cube );
  43252003274489856000
</pre>
<p>
Since this is a little bit unhandy, let us factorize this number.
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; Collected( Factors( last ) );
  [ [ 2, 27 ], [ 3, 14 ], [ 5, 3 ], [ 7, 2 ], [ 11, 1 ] ]
</pre>
<p>
(The result tells us that the size is 2^27 3^14 5^3 7^2 11.)
</p>

<p>
Next let us investigate the operation of the group on the 48 points
(we reduce the line length to get a more appropriate output format).
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; SizeScreen( [71, ] );;
  gap&gt; orbits := Orbits( cube, [1..48] );
  [ [ 1, 3, 17, 14, 8, 38, 9, 41, 19, 48, 22, 6, 30, 33, 43, 11, 46, 
        40, 24, 27, 25, 35, 16, 32 ], 
    [ 2, 5, 12, 7, 36, 10, 47, 4, 28, 45, 34, 13, 29, 44, 20, 42, 26, 
        21, 37, 15, 31, 18, 23, 39 ] ]
</pre>
<p>
The first orbit contains the points at the corners, the second those at the
edges; clearly the group cannot move a point at a corner onto a point at an
edge.
</p>

<p>
So to investigate the cube group we first investigate the operation on
the corner points. Note that the constructed group that describes this
operation will operate on the set [1..24], not on the original set
[1,3,17,14,8,38,9,41,19,48,22,6,30,33,43,11,46,40,24,27,25,35,16,32].
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; cube1 := Operation( cube, orbits[1] );
  Group( ( 1, 2, 5,12)( 3, 7,14,21)( 9,16,22,20), ( 1, 3, 8,18)
  ( 4, 7,16,23)(11,17,22,12), ( 3, 9,19,11)( 5,13, 8,16)(12,21,15,23), 
  ( 2, 6,15, 9)( 5,14,10,19)(13,21,20,24), ( 1, 4,10,20)( 2, 7,17,24)
  ( 6,14,22,18), ( 4,11,13, 6)( 8,15,10,17)(18,23,19,24) )
  gap&gt; Size( cube1 );
  88179840
</pre>
<p>
Now this group obviously operates transitively, but let us test whether
it is also primitive.
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; corners := Blocks( cube1, [1..24] );
  [ [ 1, 7, 22 ], [ 2, 14, 20 ], [ 3, 12, 16 ], [ 4, 17, 18 ], 
    [ 5, 9, 21 ], [ 6, 10, 24 ], [ 8, 11, 23 ], [ 13, 15, 19 ] ]
</pre>
<p>
Those eight blocks correspond to the eight corners of the cube; on the
one hand the group permutes those and on the other hand it permutes the
three points at each corner cyclically.
</p>

<p>
So the obvious thing to do is to investigate the operation of the group
on the eight corners.
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; cube1b := Operation( cube1, corners, OnSets );
  Group( (1,2,5,3), (1,3,7,4), (3,5,8,7), (2,6,8,5), (1,4,6,2), 
  (4,7,8,6) )
  gap&gt; Size( cube1b );
  40320
</pre>
<p>
Now a permutation group of degree 8 that has order 40320 must be the full
symmetric group S(8) on eight points.
</p>

<p>
The next thing then is to investigate the kernel of this operation on blocks,
i.e., the subgroup of <code>cube1</code> of those elements that fix the
blocks setwise.
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; blockhom1 := OperationHomomorphism( cube1, cube1b );;
  gap&gt; Factors( Size( Kernel( blockhom1 ) ) );
  [ 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 ]
  gap&gt; IsElementaryAbelian( Kernel( blockhom1 ) );
  true
</pre>
<p>
We can show that the product of this elementary abelian group 3^7 with the
S(8) is semidirect by finding a complement, i.e., a subgroup that has trivial
intersection with the kernel and that generates <code>cube1</code> together
with the kernel.
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; cmpl1 := Stabilizer( cube1, [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,13], OnSets );;
  gap&gt; Size( cmpl1 );
  40320
</pre>
<p>
We verify the complement properties:
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; Size( Intersection( cmpl1, Kernel( blockhom1 ) ) );
  1
  gap&gt; Closure( cmpl1, Kernel( blockhom1 ) ) = cube1;
  true
</pre>
<p>
There is even a more elegant way to show that <code>cmpl1</code> is a
complement.
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; IsIsomorphism( OperationHomomorphism( cmpl1, cube1b ) );
  true
</pre>
<p>
Of course, theoretically it is clear that <code>cmpl1</code> must indeed be a
complement.
</p>

<p>
In fact we know that <code>cube1</code> is a subgroup of index 3 in the
wreath product of a cyclic 3 with S(8). This missing index 3 tells us that
we do not have total freedom in turning the corners. The following tests
show that whenever we turn one corner clockwise we must turn another corner
counterclockwise.
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; (1,7,22) in cube1;
  false
  gap&gt; (1,7,22)(2,20,14) in cube1;
  true
</pre>
<p>
More or less the same things happen when we consider the operation of the
cube group on the edges.
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; cube2 := Operation( cube, orbits[2] );;
  gap&gt; Size( cube2 );
  980995276800
  gap&gt; edges := Blocks( cube2, [1..24] );
  [ [ 1, 11 ], [ 2, 17 ], [ 3, 19 ], [ 4, 22 ], [ 5, 13 ], [ 6, 8 ], 
    [ 7, 24 ], [ 9, 18 ], [ 10, 21 ], [ 12, 15 ], [ 14, 20 ], 
    [ 16, 23 ] ]
  gap&gt; cube2b := Operation( cube2, edges, OnSets );;
  gap&gt; Size( cube2b );
  479001600
  gap&gt; blockhom2 := OperationHomomorphism( cube2, cube2b );;
  gap&gt; Factors( Size( Kernel( blockhom2 ) ) );
  [ 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 ]
  gap&gt; IsElementaryAbelian( Kernel( blockhom2 ) );
  true
  gap&gt; cmpl2 := Stabilizer(cube2,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,12,14,16],OnSets);;
  gap&gt; IsIsomorphism( OperationHomomorphism( cmpl2, cube2b ) );
  true
</pre>

<p>
This time we get a semidirect product of a 2^11 with an S(12), namely a
subgroup of index 2 of the wreath product of a cyclic 2 with S(12). Here
the missing index 2 tells us again that we do not have total freedom in
turning the edges. The following tests show that whenever we flip one
edge we must also flip another edge.
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; (1,11) in cube2;
  false
  gap&gt; (1,11)(2,17) in cube2;
  true
</pre>

<p>
Since <code>cube1</code> and <code>cube2</code> are the groups describing
the actions on the two orbits of <code>cube</code>, it is clear that
<code>cube</code> is a subdirect product of those groups, i.e., a subgroup
of the direct product. Comparing the sizes of <code>cube1</code>,
<code>cube2</code>, and <code>cube</code> we see that <code>cube</code>
must be a subgroup of index 2 in the direct product of those two groups.
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; Size( cube );
  43252003274489856000
  gap&gt; Size( cube1 ) * Size( cube2 );
  86504006548979712000
</pre>
<p>
This final missing index 2 tells us that we cannot operate on corners and
edges totally independently. The following tests show that whenever we
exchange a pair of corners we must also exchange a pair of edges (and
vice versa).
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; (17,19)(11,8)(6,25) in cube;
  false
  gap&gt; (7,28)(18,21) in cube;
  false
  gap&gt; (17,19)(11,8)(6,25)(7,28)(18,21) in cube;
  true
</pre>
<p>
Finally let us compute the centre of the cube group, i.e., the subgroup
of those operations that can be performed either before or after any
other operation with the same result (we assign a name to the group
<code>cube</code> to get a nicer output).
</p>
<pre>
  gap&gt; cube.name := "cube";;
  gap&gt; Centre( cube );
  Subgroup( cube, 
  [ ( 2,34)( 4,10)( 5,26)( 7,18)(12,37)(13,20)(15,44)(21,28)(23,42)
      (29,36)(31,45)(39,47) ] )
</pre>
<p>
We see that the centre contains one nontrivial element, namely the
operation that flips all 12 edges simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
This concludes our example. Of course, GAP can do much more, 
but demonstrating them all would take too much room.
