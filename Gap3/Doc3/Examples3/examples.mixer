  As the <a href="/Doc/Bib/bib.html">Bibliography</a> shows,
  GAP has been used in a wide variety of areas of
  mathematics. These examples are intended to give some flavour of this.
  Needless to say such a list cannot be exhaustive.

    <a href="rubik.html">
    <b> Analyzing Rubik's Cube with GAP </b></a> <br />
    An example by <mixer person="Martin Schoenert" data="name"/>, 1993.
    An almost classical permutation group of small degree is examined
    with some elementary <mixer var="GAP3"/> commands.

    <a href="cavicchioli.html">
    <b> Two fundamental groups from A. Cavicchioli </b></a> <br />
    This example demonstrates some methods for the investigation of finitely
    presented groups using two presentations of fundamental groups due to
    A. Cavicchioli.

    <b> Constructing the Higman-Sims group from the number 23 </b></a> <br />
    An example presented by <mixer person="Alexander Hulpke" data="name"/>
    in the software demonstration at the 16th British Combinatorial
    Conference in London, July 1997.

    <b>Constructing Co3</b></a> <br />
    This is an extended version of the last example in the paper
    "<em>Construction of Co3. An example of the use of an integrated system
    for Computational Group Theory</em>", Groups St Andrews 1997 in Bath,
    by <mixer person="Alexander Hulpke" data="name"/> and
