  First of all read the pages
  <a href="status3.html">Status&nbsp;of&nbsp;GAP&nbsp;3</a>
  and possibly

<h3>
  The GAP&nbsp;3 branch
</h3>
<p>
  From this page we start a separate branch of Web pages for the older
  version GAP&nbsp;3.
  Please note that all pages of this GAP&nbsp;3 branch will still
  carry the top bar pointing to the main branches of the whole
  GAP site. The GAP&nbsp;3 branch has main
  subbranches that are very similar to corresponding main branches of the
  GAP site. However note that there are some pages referring
  to the whole GAP project and these will not be duplicated
  in the GAP&nbsp;3 branch. You find the main subbranches of the
  GAP&nbsp;3 branch as 'children' of the GAP&nbsp;3 page
  in the left navigator bar.

<h3>
  Development of GAP&nbsp;3
</h3>
<p>
  GAP&nbsp;3 was started at
  <a href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/LDFM/">
  Lehrstuhl&nbsp;D&nbsp;f√ºr&nbsp;Mathematik</a> of RWTH Aachen in 1986 and
  further developed there. Since 1997 it has been maintained from
  <a href="https://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/">St&nbsp;Andrews</a>.
</p>

<h3>
  User Contributions to GAP&nbsp;3
</h3>
<p>
  Over the years several pieces of code and data for GAP&nbsp;3 have
  been made available by users of GAP&nbsp;3 to other users. These
  fall into three categories which we list on different Web pages.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="Packages3/packages.html">
  GAP&nbsp;3&nbsp;Share&nbsp;Packages</a>:
  Since 1992 a set of user contributed programs has been given the status of
  'share packages' if it was thought to represent a piece of work equivalent
  to a sizeable mathematical publication.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="Datalib3/datalib.html">
  GAP&nbsp;3&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Libraries</a>:
  GAP&nbsp;3 also contains many 'data libraries' which we list on
  a separate page with a brief characterisation of their contents.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="Contrib3/contrib.html">
  GAP&nbsp;3&nbsp;Deposited&nbsp;Contributions</a>:
  Finally there are several pieces of code, listed on a third page as
  'deposited contributions' which have in no way been checked by the
  GAP team.
</p>
<p>
  There are similar lists of user contributions for GAP&nbsp;4.
  Note, however, that terminology has changed: What is called 'share package'
  here is simply called 'package' with GAP&nbsp;4. Also note that even
  where packages, data libraries or deposited contributions for
  GAP&nbsp;3 and GAP&nbsp;4 have the same or similar
  names their contents may differ considerably.
</p>

<h3>
  How to cite GAP&nbsp;3
</h3>
<p>
  If you use GAP&nbsp;3 in work that leads to a publication, please
  <a href="cite3.html">cite&nbsp;it</a>.
