<mixertitle>Status of <mixer var="GAP3"/></mixertitle>

<p>
  We strongly suggest that, whenever possible, you use <mixer var="GAP4"/>
  rather than <mixer var="GAP3"/>.
  <mixer var="GAP4"/> offers by far more facilities and much more
  mathematical functionality in its main library.
  Some differences are explained on the page
  <a href="/Gap3/Changes3/changes.html">
  <mixer var="GAP3"/>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<mixer var="GAP4"/></a>.
</p>
<p>
  The last release of <mixer var="GAP3"/> was 3.4.4 which was announced
  in the
  <a href="/Contacts/Forum/forum.html">GAP&nbsp;Forum</a>
  on April 22, 1997. <mixer var="GAP3"/> was frozen in May 2000 with
  bugfix 13 and will not be developed any further. We are still making it
  available because not only may there still be some users having private
  programs written in <mixer var="GAP3"/>, but also not all funtionality
  available through <mixer var="GAP3"/> has yet been transferred to
  <mixer var="GAP4"/>. This is in particular true for some user contributions
  to <mixer var="GAP3"/> such as the 'share packages' CHEVIE, matrix, and
  some quotient algorithms.

<h3>
  Changing from <mixer var="GAP3"/> to <mixer var="GAP4"/>
</h3>
<p>
  If you still have private programs written in <mixer var="GAP3"/> the
  functionality of which you would like to have in <mixer var="GAP4"/> it
  may be the best idea to rewrite them from scratch. However, at the time
  of the introduction of <mixer var="GAP4"/> also some material was provided
  to help in migrating from <mixer var="GAP3"/> to <mixer var="GAP4"/>. See
  <a href="/Gap3/Changes3/changes.html">
  <mixer var="GAP3"/>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<mixer var="GAP4"/></a> and the document
  <a href="migratedoc.pdf">Migrating&nbsp;to&nbsp;GAP&nbsp;4</a>.
