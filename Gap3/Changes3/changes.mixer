<p>
  For interactive use or simple programming <mixer var="GAP4"/> and
  <mixer var="GAP3"/> look alike, especially the <mixer var="GAP"/> language
  has not changed much. Few commands have changed names (only if there were
  urgent reasons) and some tasks are performed more efficiently in
  <mixer var="GAP4"/>. Nevertheless the <mixer var="GAP4"/> kernel has been
  rebuilt from the ground up (Martin Sch&ouml;nert, Frank Celler). It now
  has more efficient memory management, faster function calling, save/load
  workspace facilities, streams, and fast vector arithmetic for finite
  fields. It is easier to extend and 64 bit clean.  There is now a
  <mixer var="GAP"/> compiler that produces human-readable C code. This C
  code can be compiled and loaded dynamically (UNIX only) or compiled into
  a kernel. Compiled code is automatically loaded when it exists.
</p>
<p>
  In <mixer var="GAP3"/>, there is a clear-cut distinction between kernel
  objects such as permutations, words and elements in polycyclic groups etc.
  and objects that can be represented in the library via records. The user
  has no access to the internals of kernel objects but full access to
  library objects. In <mixer var="GAP4"/>, this distinction has been mellowed.
  Namely, there are new kinds of objects that can on one hand be designed
  by the user similar to the records of <mixer var="GAP3"/> but which can
  on the other hand be made immutable in order to be as well protected as
  the former kernel objects. These new features are intended to make
  the introduction of new data types much easier than in <mixer var="GAP3"/>.
</p>
<p>
  Examples for new data structures available in <mixer var="GAP4"/> are
  enumerators (special kinds of lists) and iterators (which admit looping
  over virtual lists).
</p>
<p>
  Also the representation of algebraic structures via records in
  <mixer var="GAP3"/> has been replaced in <mixer var="GAP4"/> by one that
  uses these new objects. The operations records of <mixer var="GAP3"/>
  have been replaced by a more flexible system. Every <mixer var="GAP4"/>
  object has a type, which is used in the choice of methods for an upcoming
  computation. Part of this type is known information about the object.
  For example, when <mixer var="GAP"/> is asked to compute the conjugacy
  classes of a group, different methods are available. One of these is a
  method for solvable groups. This method can be chosen if the group is
  known to be solvable, which would be part of its type. In particular
  this mechanism is used to utilize mathematical implications.

  Those users who want to convert existing <mixer var="GAP3"/> code into
  <mixer var="GAP4"/> code will find some advice in the document
