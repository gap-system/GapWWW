<p>
  For interactive use or simple programming GAP&nbsp;4 and
  GAP&nbsp;3 look alike, especially the GAP language
  has not changed much. Few commands have changed names (only if there were
  urgent reasons) and some tasks are performed more efficiently in
  GAP&nbsp;4. Nevertheless the GAP&nbsp;4 kernel has been
  rebuilt from the ground up (Martin Sch&ouml;nert, Frank Celler). It now
  has more efficient memory management, faster function calling, save/load
  workspace facilities, streams, and fast vector arithmetic for finite
  fields. It is easier to extend and 64 bit clean.  There is now a
  GAP compiler that produces human-readable C code. This C
  code can be compiled and loaded dynamically (UNIX only) or compiled into
  a kernel. Compiled code is automatically loaded when it exists.

<p>
  In GAP&nbsp;3, there is a clear-cut distinction between kernel
  objects such as permutations, words and elements in polycyclic groups etc.
  and objects that can be represented in the library via records. The user
  has no access to the internals of kernel objects but full access to
  library objects. In GAP&nbsp;4, this distinction has been mellowed.
  Namely, there are new kinds of objects that can on one hand be designed
  by the user similar to the records of GAP&nbsp;3 but which can
  on the other hand be made immutable in order to be as well protected as
  the former kernel objects. These new features are intended to make
  the introduction of new data types much easier than in GAP&nbsp;3.
</p>
<p>
  Examples for new data structures available in GAP&nbsp;4 are
  enumerators (special kinds of lists) and iterators (which admit looping
  over virtual lists).
</p>
<p>
  Also the representation of algebraic structures via records in
  GAP&nbsp;3 has been replaced in GAP&nbsp;4 by one that
  uses these new objects. The operations records of GAP&nbsp;3
  have been replaced by a more flexible system. Every GAP&nbsp;4
  object has a type, which is used in the choice of methods for an upcoming
  computation. Part of this type is known information about the object.
  For example, when GAP is asked to compute the conjugacy
  classes of a group, different methods are available. One of these is a
  method for solvable groups. This method can be chosen if the group is
  known to be solvable, which would be part of its type. In particular
  this mechanism is used to utilize mathematical implications.

  Those users who want to convert existing GAP&nbsp;3 code into
  GAP&nbsp;4 code will find some advice in the document
