<h3>
  The former package Weyl
</h3>
<p>
  The package "weyl" had already been superseded by the
  GAP&nbsp;3 share package "<a href="chevie.html">chevie</a>"
  and hence has not been transferred to GAP&nbsp;4.
  Note that "chevie" can only be used under GAP&nbsp;3.

  Description
</h3>
<p>
  There is a  collection  of programs for  dealing with finite Weyl groups,
  associated (Iwahori-) Hecke algebras, and their  representations.   These
  programs  were  written  by Meinolf Geck.
</p>
<p>
  On a low level, these programs provide the basic data about a fixed finite
  Weyl group W: having specified a Cartan matrix, they compute the root
  system, the reflection representation, and the permutation representation
  on the root vectors.  Elements of W can be given either as permutations
  or as reduced words in the standard generators (i.e., simply as a list of
  integers labelling the generators), and there are functions to convert
  these expressions into each other.  In particular, all functions of
  GAP&nbsp;3 for working with permutation groups can be applied.
</p>
<p>
  On  a  higher  level,  it  is  possible  to  compute distinguished  coset
  representatives and  representatives  of the conjugacy  classes of W of
  minimal  length.   Furthermore,  there   are  functions  for  calculating
  Kazhdan-Lusztig   polynomials,   left   cells,  and   the   corresponding
  representations of the associated  Hecke algebra H  (for groups of rank
  &lt;=  5, say).  Also,  computations inside  H are  possible, such  as
  multiplying two arbitrary elements of H and  expressing the result as a
  linear combination in the basis elements Tw for w in W.
