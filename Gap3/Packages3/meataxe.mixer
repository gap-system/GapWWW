  The MeatAxe package
</h3>
<p>
  Share package since release 3.3, about September 1993.<br />
  This package has not been transferred to <mixer var="GAP4"/>.
  While in <mixer var="GAP4"/> there is no direct C-meataxe interface,
  <mixer var="GAP4"/> has a proper Meataxe implementation in its kernel.

  Description
</h3>
<p>
  The C-MeatAxe, written by M. Ringe, is a collection of C-programs
  for working with matrices over finite fields. The collection
  includes programs for basic operations on matrices like multiplying
  and adding matrices, calculating nullspace of a matrix and more
  sophisticated programs, which for example determine the composition
  factors, the socle series and the lattice of submodules for a matrix
  representation of an algebra.
</p>
<p>
  The C-MeatAxe includes a C-library of functions, which deal
  with the elementary arithmetic of matrices and vectors
  of fields. These functions use a table lookup in order
  to get an optimal performance.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, the ASCII input format for matrices is compatible with the
  <a href="http://www.mat.bham.ac.uk/atlas/">
   ATLAS&nbsp;of&nbsp;finite&nbsp;group&nbsp;representations</a>
  developed by R.A. Wilson and can hence be used
  to work with the representation given in the library.
