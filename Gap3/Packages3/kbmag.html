  Description
</h3>
<p>
  KBMAG (pronounced "Kay-bee-mag") stands for <em>Knuth-Bendix on Monoids,
  and Automatic Groups</em>.  It is a stand-alone package written in C, for
  use under UNIX, with an interface to GAP&nbsp;3.
</p>
<p>
  The overall objective of KBMAG is to construct a normal form for the
  elements of a finitely presented group G in terms of the given
  generators, together with a word reduction algorithm for calculating the
  normal form representation of an element in G, given as a word in the
  generators.  If this can be achieved, then it is also possible to enumerate
  the words in normal form up to a given length, and to determine the order
  of the group, by counting the number of words in normal form. In most
  serious applications, this will be infinite, since finite groups are (with
  some exceptions) usually handled better by Todd-Coxeter related methods. In
  fact a finite state automaton W is calculated that accepts precisely the
  language of words in the group generators that are in normal form, and W
  is used for the enumeration and counting functions.  It is possible to
  inspect W directly if required; for example, it is often possible to use
  W to determine whether an element in G has finite or infinite
  order.
</p>
<p>
  The normal form for an element g in G is defined to be the least word in
  the group generators (and their inverses) that represents G, with respect
  to a specified ordering on the set of all words in the group generators.
</p>
<p>
  KBMAG offers two possible means of achieving these objectives.  The first
  is to apply the Knuth-Bendix algorithm to the group presentation, with one
  of the available orderings on words, and hope that the algorithm will
  complete with a finite confluent presentation.  (If the group is finite,
  then it is guaranteed to complete eventually but, like the Todd-Coxeter
  procedure, it may take a long time, or require more space than is
  available.)  The second is to use the automatic group program. This also
  uses the Knuth-Bendix procedure as one component of the algorithm, but it
  aims to compute certain finite state automata rather than to obtain a
  finite confluent rewriting system, and it completes successfully on many
  examples for which such a finite system does not exist. In the current
  implementation, its use is restricted to the shortlex ordering on words.
  That is, words are ordered first by increasing length, and then words of
  equal length are ordered lexicographically, using the specified ordering of
  the generators.
