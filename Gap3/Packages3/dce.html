<h3>
  Description
</h3>
<p>
  Double Coset Enumeration (DCE) can be seen either as a space- (and time-)
  saving    variant    of ordinary   Coset   Enumeration  (the Todd-Coxeter
  procedure), as a  way of constructing  finite quotients of HNN-extensions
  of known  groups or  as a way  of constructing  groups given by symmetric
  presentations in a   sense  defined by Robert   Curtis.  A  double  coset
  enumeration  works with   a finitely-presented   group   G, a  finitely
  generated subgroup  H (given by generators) and  a finite subgroup K,
  given explicitly,  usually as a  permutation group. The  action of G on
  the  cosets of H divides  into orbits under K,  and is constructed as
  such, using only a relatively small amount of information for each orbit.
