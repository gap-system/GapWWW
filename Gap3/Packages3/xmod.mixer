<h3>
  Description
</h3>
<p>
  This package enables construction of and computation with objects
  within the equivalent categories of crossed modules and
  cat1-groups, where the groups involved are finite permutation groups
  of moderately small order.
</p>
<p>
  A <em>crossed module</em> consists of two groups S and R, together
  with a homomorphism from S to R which essentially commutes with
  conjugation within S and R. Functions are provided for each of the
  standard constructions of crossed modules, and for computing with
  sub- and quotient-structures and homomorphisms.
</p>
<p>
  A <em>cat1-group</em> consists of a group  G  together with two
  homomorphisms from  G
  to  G  satisfying certain conditions. It was shown by Loday that there is
  a natural one-one correspondence between cat1-groups and crossed modules.
</p>
<p>
  An important notion is a <em>derivation</em> of a crossed module,
  which is a map from R to S satisfying certain conditions. It is
  possible to compute all (or all regular) derivations of a crossed
  module. There are also functions for computing the <em>actor</em> of
  a crossed module X, which is a crossed module whose range is the
  automorphism group of X.
