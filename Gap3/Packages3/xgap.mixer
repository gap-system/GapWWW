<h3>
  XGAP: A graphical user interface for <mixer var="GAP"/>
</h3>
<p>
  Share package since release 3.3, about October 1993.<br />
  Corresponding <mixer var="GAP4"/> package:
  <a href="/Packages/xgap.html">
  <mixer var="GAP4"/>&nbsp;package&nbsp;"xgap"</a>.
  We strongly recommend to use the <mixer var="GAP4"/> version since the
  <mixer var="GAP3"/> version was only experimental.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the package cannot be loaded from <mixer var="GAP3"/> via the
  'RequirePackage' command, but rather XGAP has to be called in the beginning
  instead of <mixer var="GAP3"/>.

<h3>
  Description
</h3>

<p>
  XGAP is a graphical user interface for <mixer var="GAP3"/>, it extends
  the <mixer var="GAP3"/> library with functions dealing with graphic
  sheets and objects. Using these functions it also supplies a graphical
  interface for investigating the subgroup lattice of a group, giving you
  easy access to the low index subgroups, prime quotient and
  Reidemeister-Schreier algorithms and many other <mixer var="GAP3"/>
  functions for groups and subgroups.  At the moment the only supported
  window system is X-Windows X11R5, however, programs using the XGAP
  library functions will run on other platforms as soon as XGAP is available
  on these.
