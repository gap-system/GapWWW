  Description
</h3>
<p>
  A package for calculating decomposition numbers of Hecke algebras
  of the symmetric groups and q-Schur algebras.
</p>
<p>
  This package contains functions for computing the decomposition
  matrices for Hecke algebras of the symmetric groups. As the
  (modular) representation theory of these algebras closely resembles
  that of the (modular) representation theory of the symmetric groups
  - indeed, the later is a special case of the former - many of the
  combinatorial tools from the representation theory of the symmetric
  group are included in this package.
</p>
<p>
  These programs grew out of the attempts by Gordon James and myself
  to understand the decomposition matrices of Hecke algebras of type A
  when q = -1. The package is now much more general and its' highlights
  include:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Specht provides a means of working in the Grothendieck ring of a
    Hecke algebra H using the three natural bases corresponding to the
    Specht modules, projective indecomposable modules, and simple modules.
  </li>
  <li>
    For Hecke algebras defined over fields of characteristic zero we
    have implemented the algorithm of Lascoux, Leclerc, and Thibon  for
    computing decomposition numbers and "crystallized decomposition
    matrices". In principle, this gives all of the decomposition matrices
    of Hecke algebras defined over fields of characteristic zero.
  </li>
  <li>
    We provide a way of inducing and restricting modules. In addition,
    it is possible to "induce" decomposition matrices; this function is
    quite effective in calculating the decomposition matrices of Hecke
    algebras for small n.
  </li>
  <li>
    The q-analogue of Schaper's theorem  is included, as is
    Kleshchev's [K] algorithm of calculating the Mullineux map. Both are
    used extensively when inducing decomposition matrices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Specht can be used to compute the decomposition numbers of
    q-Schur algebras (and the general linear groups), although there is
    less direct support for these algebras. The decomposition matrices for the
    q-Schur algebras defined over fields of characteristic zero for n &lt; 11
    and all e are included in Specht.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Littlewood-Richard rule, its inverse, and functions for many
    of the standard operations on partitions (such as calculating cores,
    quotients, and adding and removing hooks), are included.
  </li>
  <li>
    The decomposition matrices for the symmetric groups Sym_n are
    included for n &lt; 15 and for all primes.
  </li>
