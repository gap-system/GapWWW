<h3>
  XGAP: A graphical user interface for GAP
</h3>
<p>
  Share package since release 3.3, about October 1993.<br />
  Corresponding GAP&nbsp;4 package:
  <a href="/Packages/xgap.html">
  GAP&nbsp;4&nbsp;package&nbsp;"xgap"</a>.
  We strongly recommend to use the GAP&nbsp;4 version since the
  GAP&nbsp;3 version was only experimental.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the package cannot be loaded from GAP&nbsp;3 via the
  'RequirePackage' command, but rather XGAP has to be called in the beginning
  instead of GAP&nbsp;3.

  Description
</h3>

<p>
  XGAP is a graphical user interface for GAP&nbsp;3, it extends
  the GAP&nbsp;3 library with functions dealing with graphic
  sheets and objects. Using these functions it also supplies a graphical
  interface for investigating the subgroup lattice of a group, giving you
  easy access to the low index subgroups, prime quotient and
  Reidemeister-Schreier algorithms and many other GAP&nbsp;3
  functions for groups and subgroups.  At the moment the only supported
  window system is X-Windows X11R5, however, programs using the XGAP
  library functions will run on other platforms as soon as XGAP is available
  on these.
