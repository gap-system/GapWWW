<h3>
  Description
</h3>
<p>
  The aim of the matrix package is to provide  integrated and comprehensive
  access to a collection  of algorithms, developed  primarily over the past
  decade, for   investigating the structure of   matrix groups defined over
  finite fields.  We sought to design  a package which provides easy access
  to  existing  algorithms and implementations,   and which both allows new
  algorithms   to be  developed  easily using  existing  components, and to
  update existing ones readily.
</p>
<p>
  Some    of the facilities    provided  are necessarily  limited, both  on
  theoretical and practical  grounds; others are  <em>experimental</em> and
  developmental in nature; we welcome criticism  of their performance.  One
  motivation for its release is to encourage input from others.
</p>
<p>
  The development and organisation of this package was carried out in Aachen
  by Frank Celler, Eamonn O'Brien and Anthony Pye.
</p>
<p>
  In addition  to the new   material, this  package combines, updates,  and
  replaces material from various contributing sources.  These include:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Classic package - originally developed by Celler;
  </li>
  <li>
    Smash  package   -  originally  developed   by   Holt, Leedham-Green,
    O'Brien, and Rees;
  </li>
  <li>
    Niemeyer/Praeger  classical   recognition   algorithm   -  originally
    developed by Niemeyer;
  </li>
  <li>
    Recursive code - originally developed by Pye.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  As part of the preparation of this package,  much of the contributed code
  was revised (sometimes  significantly)  and  streamlined,  in cooperation
  with the original developers.
