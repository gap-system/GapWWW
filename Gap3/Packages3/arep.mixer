  Description
</h3>
<p>
  The package AREP was developed to create data structures and
  functions for the efficient calculation with group representations
  with special attention to permutation and monomial representations.
  The idea is to calculate with representations up to equality not
  only up to equivalence as it is usually done in representation theory.
  Furthermore we wanted to be able to create highly structured
  representations in GAP&nbsp;3 as you do it on a piece of paper
  by writing e.g.
</p>
  <pre>  R = (R1 innerTensorProduct R2) induction G, </pre>
<p>
  where R1, R2 are representations and G is a group. The representation
  R constructed this way should be kept this way; it should not be
  evaluated until you ask for it.
  In this sense we have implemented an infrastructure for representations.
  The more advanced part is given by functions which allow to transform
  a given representation. These functions are mostly decompositions in
  a certain sense. E.g. it is well known that every transitive monomial
  representation of a group G is equivalent to an induction of a
  onedimensional representation of a subgroup H &lt;= G. But how do
  you choose the subgroup, the transversal and the conjugation to obtain
  equality? This problem is solved by the function

  <code>TransitiveToInductionMonRep</code>   (in <code>lib/arepfcts.g</code>)

  which transforms a given transitive monomial rep R into the form
</p>
  <pre>  R = (L induction_By_T G)^D, </pre>
<p>
  where L is a onedimensional rep of a subgroup. A more sophisticated
  function for constructively decomposing a given representation
  is the function

  <code>DecompositionMonRep</code>  (in <code>lib/arepfcts.g</code>)

  which decomposes a monomial rep R into a conjugated direct sum
  of irreducibles of the form
</p>
  <pre>R = (R1 directSum R2 ... Rk)^A</pre>
<p>
  where <code>Ri, i = 1..k</code> are irreducible and the (inverted)
  decomposition matrix A is explicitly given, even in a highly structured
  form!
</p>
<p>
  A striking application of constructive representation theory
  is the decomposition of matrices with symmetry. This technique
  allows to explain and generate a lot of classical fast signal
  transforms.
  The original idea is due to Minkwitz  and was further
  developed by the authors.
</p>
<p>
  Abstractly, a symmetry of a given matrix M is given by a pair (R1, R2)
  of representations of the same group G, such that
</p>
  <pre>  R1(g) * M = M * R2(g) for all g in G. </pre>
<p>
  If R1 and R2 both are permutation representations we call
  the symmetry Perm-Perm-Symmetry. Mon-Mon-Symmetry is defined
  analogous. Functions to determine the symmetry of a given matrix
  can be found in <code>lib/symmetry.g</code>.
  If a matrix possesses symmetry of the types above, it can be
  decomposed into a product of sparse matrices (see [2], [3]).
  Functions implementing this idea can be found in algogen.g
  allowing to generate wellknown fast signal
  transforms such as Cooley-Tukey-FFT, Rader-FFT,
  Fast Cosine Transforms, and others in an automatic way.

  In order for you to get a better impression of what
  AREP can do and can not do we have prepared some
  examples for you (see: Documentation and Examples).
  These examples are ordered according to the library files.

  Every GAP&nbsp;3 file in the library lib/ contains a short
  documentation including the specification of all important functions.
  This documentation can be accessed by extracting all lines beginning
  with: <code>#F</code>.
  For example, on a UNIX system
</p>
  <pre>
  cd lib/
  grep #F complex.g
  </pre>
<p>
  tells you about the functions in 'complex.g'.
  We recommend to extract these documentations before you
  proceed with the examples below.
