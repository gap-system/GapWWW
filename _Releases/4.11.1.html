<p>
You may also consider one of the
<a href="../Download/alternatives.html">alternative distributions</a>.
Note, however, that these are updated independently and may not yet
provide the latest GAP release.
</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>
For users of Windows 10, we strongly recommend using GAP via the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem
  for Linux</a>.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, we recommend the use of the following <code>.exe</code> installer, which contains 64-bit binaries for GAP
(compiled with the support of GMP and readline libraries) and for selected
GAP packages, and provides the standard installation procedure.
</p>

<p>
Note that the path to the GAP directory should not contain spaces. For example,
you may install it in <code>C:\gap-{{page.version}}</code> (default), <code>D:\gap-{{page.version}}</code> or
<code>C:\Math\GAP\gap-{{page.version}}</code>, but you must not install it in a directory named like
<code>C:\Program files\gap-{{page.version}}</code> or <code>C:\Users\alice\My Documents\gap-{{page.version}}</code> etc.
