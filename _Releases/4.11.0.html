You may also consider one of the
<a href="../Download/alternatives.html">alternative distributions</a>.
Note, however, that these are updated independently and may not yet
provide the latest GAP release.
</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>
We strongly recommend to use the <code>.exe</code> installer which contains 64-bit binaries for GAP
(compiled with the support of GMP and readline libraries) and for selected
GAP packages, and provides the standard installation procedure. Note that the
path to the GAP directory should not contain spaces. For example, 
you may install it in <code>C:\gap-{{page.version}}</code> (default), <code>D:\gap-{{page.version}}</code> or 
<code>C:\Math\GAP\gap-{{page.version}}</code>, but you must not install it in a directory named like 
<code>C:\Program files\gap-{{page.version}}</code> or <code>C:\Users\alice\My Documents\gap-{{page.version}}</code> etc.

The <code>.exe</code> installer should work for the majority of users. Alternatively 
(for example, if you don't have administrator's privileges on your Windows
computer), you may use the <code>-win.zip</code> archive with 64-bit GAP for Windows,
and edit <code>.bat</code> files manually following instructions from the
<a href="https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/v{{page.version}}/INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md</a> 
file.

We also provide 32-bit archives of GAP for Windows, built with and 
without readline support. You may try the latter archive in case of
technical problems (e.g. command line editing doesn't work, or GAP
crashes at startup) to check if they are caused by readline.
