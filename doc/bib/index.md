There is a [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=B2oZOG0AAAAJ)
for the GAP system and some of its packages, where citations are added
automatically as soon as they are detected by Google.

Another independent source of citations for GAP and packages is
[zbMATH](https://www.zbmath.org/). There is a dedicated page tracking
[GAP at zbMATH](https://zbmath.org/software/320) from which one can access
a [list of publications citing GAP](https://zbmath.org/?q=si%3A320).

We also used to produce our own bibliography of work involving and giving
acknowledgement to GAP but this has not been maintained since 2022. You can
still download the [old .bib file here]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/bib/gap-publishednicer.bib).

For quoting the use of GAP in your publications we provide
standard forms for [citing GAP 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/cite/).
