 See also the page on
 [Learning GAP]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/learn/learning.html),
 which refers to material that may help you if you want to learn 
 GAP on your own or to teach it.

  GAP has been used in lecture courses of various levels,
  both for providing examples and for creating teaching material, in
  particular exercises. In 2012, we conducted a survey on this topic,
  and its results are published on the
  [LMS De Morgan Forum](http://education.lms.ac.uk/2012/03/gap-in-teaching/).
  We are currently conducting a new survey about the use of mathematical
  software in education at [https://bit.ly/mse-survey](https://bit.ly/mse-survey).

  However, it is not always the case that
  such teaching materials are available to the public. We therefore
  ask to inform [The GAP Group](mailto:support@gap-system.org)
  if you have such material and are willing to share it with others.

  At present we can point to the following material.
