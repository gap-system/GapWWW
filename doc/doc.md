  There is a lot of written material telling about the functionality
  and use of GAP, providing information about algorithmic
  background and giving hints for writing own GAP code.

- ### Manuals
  For the users of GAP we provide a
  [Tutorial]({{ site.docsurl }}/doc/tut/chap0_mj.html)
  giving a first introduction to the system and a
  <a href="{{ site.docsurl }}/doc/ref/chap0_mj.html">
  Reference Manual</a>
  with complete descriptions of all library functions and examples of
  their use. Most essential changes from previous GAP 
  releases are described in the
  [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/master/CHANGES.md) file. 
  There is also an 
  [HPC-GAP]({{ site.docsurl }}/doc/hpc/chap0_mj.html) version.
  Each GAP package has its individual manual which you can
  access through the list of [Packages]({{ site.baseurl }}/packages/).

- ### [Learning GAP]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/learn)
  In addition to the
  [Tutorial]({{ site.docsurl }}/doc/tut/chap0_mj.html)
  mentioned above there is a variety of material intended to help people
  to learn on their own the GAP language and the use of
  the GAP system. We have tried to organize links to such
  material somewhat according to the level and intended audience on the
  page quoted in the heading.


- ### [Teaching Material]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/teach/)
  GAP has been used in several places to support the
  teaching of a variety of courses. We are grateful to the colleagues
  who allowed us to point to some course material of such courses and
  we would appreciate to obtain access to further such material.
  We hope that this can be helpful to colleagues intending a
  similar use of GAP, but it may also be used by
  students studying the topics of such courses.

- ### The GAP [Bibliography]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/bib/bib.html)
  We maintain a bibliography of papers citing GAP. Some of
  these papers describe applications of GAP, others
  algorithmic methods that are implemented in GAP. We hope
  that looking at these papers will be helpful for users and we ask that
  you help us to keep this bibliography up to date by sending us the
  bibliographical data of your own publications citing GAP.
  Note that some of the listed papers may still refer to use of
  GAP 3 rather than GAP 4.
