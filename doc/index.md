  There is a lot of written material telling about the functionality
  and use of GAP, providing information about algorithmic
  background and giving hints for writing own GAP code.

- ### Manuals
  - The [Tutorial]({{ site.docsurl }}/doc/tut/chap0_mj.html) ([PDF]({{ site.docsurl }}/doc/tut/manual.pdf))
    gives a first introduction to the system
  - The [Reference Manual]({{ site.docsurl }}/doc/ref/chap0_mj.html) ([PDF]({{ site.docsurl }}/doc/ref/manual.pdf))
    with complete descriptions of all library functions and examples of
    their use.
  - The [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/master/CHANGES.md)
    file describes most essential changes between all GAP releases.
  - Each GAP package has its individual manual which you can
    access through the list of [packages]({{ site.baseurl }}/packages/).

- ### [Learning GAP]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/learn)
  In addition to the
  [Tutorial]({{ site.docsurl }}/doc/tut/chap0_mj.html)
  mentioned above there is a variety of material intended to help people
  to learn on their own the GAP language and the use of
  the GAP system. We have tried to organize links to such
  material somewhat according to the level and intended audience on the
  page quoted in the heading.

- ### [Teaching Material]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/teach/)
  GAP has been used in several places to support the
  teaching of a variety of courses. We are grateful to the colleagues
  who allowed us to point to some course material of such courses and
  we would appreciate to obtain access to further such material.
  We hope that this can be helpful to colleagues intending a
  similar use of GAP, but it may also be used by
  students studying the topics of such courses.

- ### Bibliographies
  - There is a [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=B2oZOG0AAAAJ)
  for the GAP system and some of its packages, where citations are added
  automatically as soon as they are detected by Google.
  - Another independent source of citations for GAP and packages is
  [zbMATH](https://www.zbmath.org/). There is a dedicated page tracking
  [GAP at zbMATH](https://zbmath.org/software/320) from which one can access
  a [list of publications citing GAP](https://zbmath.org/?q=si%3A320).
  - We also used to produce our own bibliography of work involving and giving
  acknowledgement to GAP but this has not been maintained since 2022. You can
  still download the [old .bib file here]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/bib/gap-publishednicer.bib).
