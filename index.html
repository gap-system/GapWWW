<h3>
  What is GAP?
</h3>
<p>
  GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with
  particular emphasis on
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/references.html">Computational&nbsp;Group&nbsp;Theory</a>.
  GAP provides a
  {% include ref.html manual="Reference: The Programming Language" text="programming&nbsp;language" %}, a library of thousands of
  functions implementing
  algebraic algorithms written in the GAP language as well
  as large <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Datalib/datalib.html">data&nbsp;libraries</a> of
  algebraic objects. See also the
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Overview/overview.html">overview</a> and the description of the
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Overview/Capabilities/capabilities.html">
  mathematical&nbsp;capabilities</a>.
  GAP is used in
  research and teaching for studying groups and their representations,
  rings, vector spaces, algebras,
  combinatorial structures, and more. The system, including source, is
  distributed <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Download/copyright.html#free">freely</a>.  
  You can study and easily modify or extend it for your special use.
</p>
<p>
In July 2008, GAP was awarded the <i>ACM/SIGSAM
Richard Dimick <a href="http://www.sigsam.org/awards/jenks/index.html">Jenks 
Memorial Prize</a> for Excellence in
Software Engineering applied to Computer Algebra</i>.

<p>
  We welcome contributions to GAP.
  The GAP development repository is hosted on
  <a href="https://github.com/gap-system/gap">GitHub</a>.
  You may find some guidance on contributing via GitHub
  <a href="https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">here</a>.
  If you have any questions, or suggestions for GAP, the repository,
  or documentation, feel free to contact us via the
  <a href="https://mail.gap-system.org/mailman/listinfo/gap">open GAP development mailing list</a>
  or submit an issue or a pull request on GitHub.
</p>
<p>
  There is an <a href="Doc/doc.html">extensive documentation</a> advising
  how to write a GAP code. Also there is a
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Packages/example.html">guidance</a> on developing a
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Packages/packages.html">GAP package </a> and its
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/submit.html">submission</a> to GAP.

<p>
  The
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/People/people.html">GAP&nbsp;Group</a>
  welcomes 
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/contacts.html">contacts</a>
  with the GAP users and offers support for them.

  use of GAP in research or teaching. We may well
  want to provide a link to your work. If your work is published
  then we ask you to
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/cite.html">cite</a> GAP like a
  journal article or book.
  We maintain a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/Bib/bib.html">Bibliography</a> of

  Acknowledgements
</h3>

<p>
  GAP has been and is developed by international
  cooperation of many
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/People/people.html">people</a>, including user
  contributions. We gratefully acknowledge all this help as well as some
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/funding.html">funding</a>.
  GAP was started at 
  <a href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/LDFM/">
  Lehrstuhl D f√ºr Mathematik</a>, RWTH Aachen in 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/History/preface_2.4.html">1986</a>. After 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/ForumArchive/Neubuese.1/Joachim.1/GAP,_199.1/1.html">1997</a> the
  development of GAP was coordinated in 
  <a href="https://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/">St Andrews</a>.
  At present, the 
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/centres.html">GAP&nbsp;Centers</a> in 
  <a href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/LDFM/">Aachen</a>,
  <a href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/icm/algebra/">Braunschweig</a>,
  <a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~hulpke/">Fort&nbsp;Collins</a> and 
  <a href="https://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/">St Andrews</a>
  are jointly coordinating the further development and maintenance 
  of GAP.
