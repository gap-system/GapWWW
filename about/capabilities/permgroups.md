## Permutation and Matrix Groups

For an overview of computational methods for permutation groups see
for example the book "Permutation Group Algorithms" of
√Åkos Seress. Historically, these methods
started with Charles Sims' method for finding the order and a stabilizer
chain nowadays known as the Schreier-Sims method, which is the basis of
many functions implemented in GAP. To give a small sample
of further special methods:
The nearly linear time methods for permutation groups include functions
to compute

- a stabilizer chain,
- p-core,
- radical,
- centre,
- composition series.

There are also tasks for which no polynomial time methods are known and
for which GAP relies on partition backtrack methods, for
example

- centralizer,
- normalizer, or
- intersection of subgroups.

The GAP4 package [RCWA](https://gap-packages.github.io/rcwa/)
provides   methods  for  computations   with  the   so-called  Residue
Class-Wise  Affine   mappings  of  certain  euclidian   rings  R  into
themselves  and the  groups generated  by bijective  mappings  of this
type.  The latter mappings form a proper subgroup of Sym(R).

For {%- include ref.html label="Matrix Groups" text="matrix groups" %}
there are also special methods in the GAP library
and a private GAP4 package 
[matrixss](http://matrixss.sourceforge.net) 
implements  a
[Schreier-Sims algorithm for matrix groups](http://henrik.baarnhielm.net/schreiersims.pdf),
including both the standard deterministic and the standard
probabilistic approach.

The package
[Polenta](https://gap-packages.github.io/polenta/) allows to find

for matrix groups.
