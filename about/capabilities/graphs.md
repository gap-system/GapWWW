## Graphs, Codes, and Designs

The package
[GRAPE](https://gap-packages.github.io/grape) allows one
to construct graphs (with or without using  groups), to determine many
invariants of graphs, to  classify complete subgraphs with various
properties, to determine automorphism groups of graphs, and to test
graph isomorphism (the  last two via an interface to B.D. McKay's
[nauty](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/implement/nauty/implement.shtml) package).
A special feature of this package is the use of (subgroups of) the
automorphism group of a graph (and hence of permutation group methods)
to reduce the store required for many graphs and to reduce the time
taken by many graph-theoretical algorithms.

The package
[GUAVA](https://gap-packages.github.io/guava) can
construct many classes of codes, derive invariants such as minimal
distance and weight distribution and find their automorphism groups.

The  package
[Design](https://gap-packages.github.io/design)
provides classification, partitioning, and study of block designs,
including the determination of automorphism groups, the testing of
isomorphism, and the calculation of statistical efficiency measures
of 1-designs using exact methods.

[DISCRETA](http://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/discreta/),
which is freely available for research and educational use.)

The package
[RDS](https://gap-packages.github.io/rds/)
provides functions for the complete enumeration and construction
of relative difference sets and the corresponding projective planes.
The constructed planes can be analysed using the
[Design](https://gap-packages.github.io/design) package.
