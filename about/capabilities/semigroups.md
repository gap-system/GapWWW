## Semigroups, Monoids, and other Generalisations of Groups

These include
- functions for calculating with
  {%- include ref.html label="Transformations" text="transformations" %},
- functions for investigating
  {%- include ref.html label="Semigroups" text="semigroups" %},
  in particular transformation semigroups,
  {%- include ref.html label="Monoids" text="monoids" %}, and
  {%- include ref.html label="Finitely Presented Semigroups and Monoids" text="finitely presented semigroups and monoids" %},
- sets of basic functions for
  {%- include ref.html label="Magmas" text="magmas" %} and
  {%- include ref.html label="Additive Magmas" text="additive magmas" %},
- a package
  [SONATA](https://gap-packages.github.io/sonata/) for investigating near rings,
- a package
  [XMod](https://gap-packages.github.io/xmod/) for crossed modules and cat-1 groups,
- a package 
  [GPD](https://gap-packages.github.io/groupoids/) 
  for computation of finite groupoids, 
- a package 
  [Loops](https://gap-packages.github.io/loops/) for various types of loops,
- a package 
  [Semigroups](https://semigroups.github.io/Semigroups) (former Citrus)
  for computing with semigroups of transformations and partial permutations,
  or subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups, and also with
  free inverse semigroups,
- a package 
  [Smallsemi](https://gap-packages.github.io/smallsemi/), providing a data library
  of all semigroups with at most 8 elements,
- a package 
  [NumericalSgps](https://gap-packages.github.io/numericalsgps) 
  for computations with numerical semigroups, and
- a package 
  [SgpViz](https://gap-packages.github.io/sgpviz) for semigroup visualization.
