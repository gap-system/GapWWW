GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular
emphasis on Computational Group Theory.
GAP provides a {% include ref.html label="The Programming Language"
text="programming language" %}, a library of thousands of functions
implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP language as well as
large data libraries of
algebraic objects.

### Structure of GAP

GAP has a kernel written in C. It implements
- the GAP language,
- an interactive environment for developing and using GAP programs,
- memory management, and
- fast versions of time critical operations for various data types.

All the remaining functions of the library are written in the
GAP language. Packages are mainly written in the
GAP language, but some also involve standalones. Some
packages provide links to other systems.


### GAP provides:
- [Mathematical capabilities]({{ site.baseurl }}/capabilities/),
- A {% include ref.html label="The Programming Language" text="programming language" %},
  also called GAP,
- An {% include ref.html label="Main Loop and Break Loop" text="interactive environment" %}.
