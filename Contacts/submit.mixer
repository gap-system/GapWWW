Submitting Contributions to <mixer var="GAP"/>
</mixertitle>

<p>
  The <mixer var="GAP"/> group encourages users to make their
  <mixer var="GAP"/> related work available to other users. There are two
  main categories of external contributions to <mixer var="GAP"/>, those
  that have been formally accepted in a
  <a href="#refereeing">refereeing&nbsp;process</a>, and those that are
  just deposited.
</p>
<p>
  Irrespective of this distinction, you may consider organizing and maybe
  distributing your code in the form of a <mixer var="GAP"/> package.
  The page
  <a href="/Packages/Authors/authors.html">
  Information&nbsp;for&nbsp;<mixer var="GAP"/>&nbsp;Package&nbsp;Authors</a>
  give detailed advice how to do this.
</p>

<h3>
  Submitting Material for Formal Refereeing
</h3>
<p>
  The author of a contribution that is intended for formal acceptance
  should begin the process by notifying the Chair of the
  <a href="/Contacts/People/Council/council.html">
  <mixer var="GAP"/>&nbsp;Council</a> by emailing
  <mixer person="gap-council" data="email_link"/>, providing full
  information where the complete material has been placed.
</p>

<h3>
  Submitting Deposited Contributions
</h3>
<p>
  You are also invited to provide material that is not intended for formal
  refereeing. To tell us about such material, contact
  <mixer person="GAP" data="email_link"/>. (Packages can also be put into
  this category while refereeing is in process.)

<h3>
  <a name="refereeing">The Refereeing Process</a>
</h3>
<p>
  At its June 1997 meeting in Oberwolfach the
  <a href="/Contacts/People/Council/council.html">
  <mixer var="GAP"/>&nbsp;Council</a> established the category of
  "formally accepted" contributions, and agreed upon the following
  procedures for refereeing.
</p>

<!--<blockquote>-->
<hr />
<p>
  Materials submitted for formal acceptance as part of the <mixer var="GAP"/> 
  distribution, typically packages or proposed additions to the
  <mixer var="GAP"/> library, will undergo an additional review resembling
  the refereeing process for journal articles. As with submitted journal
  articles, authors will have the option during the review process of
  withholding their contributions from being made public in the /deposit
  directory.
</p>
<p>
  Upon being notified of the author's intent, the Chair, acting as 
  editor-in-chief, will notify the Council about the submission and will
  designate a member of the Council as the associate editor responsible
  for the submission. The associate editor may draw upon 
  the services of additional referees, including experts familiar with the 
  programming issues involved, to determine whether the material is 
  suitable for formal acceptance or to recommend revisions. Once the 
  responsible editor concludes that the contribution is ready to be part of 
  the <mixer var="GAP"/> distribution, it will be announced to the
  <mixer var="GAP"/> Forum and listed on the <mixer var="GAP"/> Web page,
  and the materials will be included in the next appropriate release of
  <mixer var="GAP"/>.
</p>
<p>
  The author should not alter the submitted material during the refereeing
  process without notifying the editor.
</p>
<!--</blockquote>-->
<hr />

<p>
  The intent of the formal review process is not only to encourage the
  development of the best possible <mixer var="GAP"/> materials but also
  to provide authors with recognition for their professional contributions
  more or less equivalent to that for publication of a journal article.
  In particular, referees are expected to apply standards comparable to
  those they would use for articles. It is not unusual for a referee to
  propose extensive modifications as conditions of acceptance.
</p>
<p>
  A referee will consider the following basic questions in reviewing a
  submitted <mixer var="GAP"/> package.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Does the package do what it claims to?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is its functionality a significant addition to <mixer var="GAP"/>?
  </li>
  <li>
    Does the package interact smoothly with the existing <mixer var="GAP"/>
    library and packages?
  </li>
  <li>
    Does the package employ appropriate <mixer var="GAP"/> functions and
    data structures?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is the main documentation clear and complete enough?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This last point is especially important. The installation of the package
  must work as described in the installation guide, without help from
  system staff. The package's documentation should include straightforward
  and quick examples to help the user test the installation, the examples
  of the manual must really work the way the manual says, and the overall
  documentation should be organized sensibly.
</p>
<p>
  The referee will also ask how the package reacts to unexpected or very
  special input. Does it work for the trivial group, the empty list, etc?
</p>
<p>
  Adherence to these standards is critical both for maintaining reliably
  high quality in the <mixer var="GAP"/> distribution and for providing
  package authors with credible professional recognition of their work.
</p>
<p>
  The Council is actively seeking contributions, not only for formal
  acceptance, but also for all of the /deposit subdirectories. If you have
  materials that might be suitable, please consider making them available
  to the whole <mixer var="GAP"/> community. Please also feel free to write
  directly to any member of the Council about possible contributed materials
  or about any other <mixer var="GAP"/>-related matters of which the Council
  should be aware. We provide a list with the names and current mail and
  email addresses of the
  <a href="/Contacts/People/Council/members.html">members</a> of the
  <mixer var="GAP"/> Council.
