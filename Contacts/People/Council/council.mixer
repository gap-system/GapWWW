<mixertitle>The <mixer var="GAP"/> Council</mixertitle>

<p>
  The <mixer var="GAP"/> Council, consisting of a number of senior
  mathematicians and computer scientists engaged in a broad spectrum of
  areas in computational group theory, was formed in 1995 to provide broad
  policy advice for the future development of <mixer var="GAP"/>. It serves
  as an editorial board, but its interests extend more broadly, to include
  enhancing recognition not only of <mixer var="GAP"/> itself but also of
  the whole field of computational group theory. This larger role means,
  in particular, that if you become aware of ways in which the Council can
  promote greater understanding and awareness of CGT we would appreciate
  your telling us, so we can lend our support.
</p>
<p>
  Although the Council is not intended to be a representative body, its
  members come from all over the globe and from many parts of the CGT
  landscape, so there is a good chance that you already know, or know of,
  at least one Council member. Since one of the Council's roles is to seek
  out and encourage the development of new contributions to
  <mixer var="GAP"/>, and since we may not be aware of your interests,
  we encourage you not to wait to be contacted but to correspond directly
  with any of the Council members if you have information that we can use.
</p>
<p>
  In its role as editorial board, the <mixer var="GAP"/> Council
  coordinates the process by which submitted <mixer var="GAP"/> packages
  are refereed. In that sense, the Council chairman acts as editor in
  chief, and the other members function as "associate editors," after the
  fashion of some journals. It is appropriate to obtain advice on submitting
  a package from any of the Council members. To submit a package, the Chair
  of the Council should be informed (by emailing
  <mixer person="gap-council" data="email_link"/>). For more details, see
  the page on <a href="/Contacts/submit.html">submission&nbsp;procedures</a>.
