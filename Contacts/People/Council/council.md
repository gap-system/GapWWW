The GAP Council, consisting of a number of senior
mathematicians and computer scientists engaged in a broad spectrum of
areas in computational group theory, was formed in 1995 to provide broad
policy advice for the future development of GAP. It serves
as an editorial board, but its interests extend more broadly, to include
enhancing recognition not only of GAP itself but also of
the whole field of computational group theory. This larger role means,
in particular, that if you become aware of ways in which the Council can
promote greater understanding and awareness of CGT (computational group
theory) we would appreciate your telling us, so we can lend our support.

Although the Council is not intended to be a representative body, its
members come from all over the globe and from many parts of the CGT
landscape, so there is a good chance that you already know, or know of,
at least one Council member. Since one of the Council's roles is to seek
out and encourage the development of new contributions to
GAP, and since we may not be aware of your interests,
we encourage you not to wait to be contacted but to correspond directly
with any of the Council members if you have information that we can use.

In its role as editorial board, the GAP Council
coordinates the process by which submitted GAP packages
are refereed. In that sense, the Council Chair acts as editor in
chief, and the other members function as "associate editors," after the
fashion of some journals. It is appropriate to obtain advice on submitting
a package from any of the Council members. To submit a package, the Chair
of the Council should be informed (by emailing
<council@gap-system.org>). For more details, see
the page on [submission&nbsp;procedures]({{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/submit.html).
