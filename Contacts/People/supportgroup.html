<h3>
This is the web page for the Support Group of the mathematical software package GAP.
</h3> 
<p>
The preferred way to submit bug reports is to use the
<a href="https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues">GAP issue tracker</a>
on GitHub. Alternatively, you may send them to <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a>. 
When using email, please mention the version of GAP and the
operating system you are using. Also, please don't attach any log files,
suggested patches etc. because this mailing list blocks attachments - put all
the text into the body of email instead.
</p>
<p>
If you don't find instructions helping you do the computation you wish to do 
in the <a href="../../Doc/Examples/examples.html">examples</a> or 
online <a href="../../Doc/doc.html">documentation</a>,
perhaps the Support Group can help as well. In general, we recommend to 
contact <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a> with questions that are
not likely to be interesting for the several hundred subscribers of the 
<a href="/Contacts/Forum/forum.html">GAP&nbsp;Forum</a>,
or to <a href="mailto:forum@gap-system.org">forum@gap-system.org</a>, if you think they may
be a general interest. 
</p>
<p>
Please do not normally write to the individual members of the Support Group.
Each of them will see all questions sent to <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a>,
but they will be also seen by a broader pool of people, and the answers will
be recorded and might help others in the future.
