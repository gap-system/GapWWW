<h3>
This is the web page for the Support Group of the mathematical software package GAP.
</h3> 

The preferred way to submit bug reports is to use the
[GAP issue tracker](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues)
on GitHub. Alternatively, you may send them to <support@gap-system.org>. 
When reporting a bug, please follow [these guidelines](trouble.html).

If you don't find instructions helping you do the computation you wish to do 
in the [examples](../../Doc/Examples/examples.html) or 
online [documentation](./../Doc/doc.html),
perhaps the Support Group can help as well. In general, we recommend to 
contact <support@gap-system.org> with questions that are
not likely to be interesting for the several hundred subscribers of the 
[GAP&nbsp;Forum](../Forum/forum.html),
or to <forum@gap-system.org>, if you think they may
be a general interest. 

Please do not normally write to the individual members of the Support Group.
Each of them will see all questions sent to <support@gap-system.org>,
but they will be also seen by a broader pool of people, and the answers will
be recorded and might help others in the future.

The present members of the Support Group are:

- Bill Allombert
