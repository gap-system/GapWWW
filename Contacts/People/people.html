<h3>The GAP&nbsp;Group</h3>

Many people have helped in different ways to develop the GAP
system, to maintain it, and to provide advice and support for users.
All of these are refered to as the 'GAP&nbsp;Group'.

<h3>
  GAP Authors
</h3>
<p>
  The page <a href="authors.html">GAP&nbsp;Authors</a> lists
  people who have at various times written code for the kernel or library
  of GAP. We have collected this list to the best of our
  knowledge, but we apologize for any omissions. It should be understood
  that some of these contributions date back to the beginning of the
  GAP project and may not even be any longer part of the
  present distribution.
</p>

<h3>
  Module authors and maintainers
</h3>
<p>
  It is also clear that the contributions of different people vary
  significantly in size. Therefore and in view of the total size of the
  GAP library we decided in 2001 to introduce the concept
  of 'modules'. A module is a part of GAP that
</p>
<ul>
  <li> provides a describable functionality, </li>
  <li> consists of a discrete set of files, </li>
  <li> has a well-defined set of authors and maintainers. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  On a separate page we provide a list of these
  <a href="modules.html">Modules</a> in which for each module we give
  the authors and maintainers as well as a brief description of its
  functionality in one line. 
</p>
<p>
  There are some GAP authors with substantial contributions
  to GAP that are not definable as modules, but may be even
  considered as the backbone of the system. Of these, in the first place
  Martin Schönert should be mentioned who has been the system architect
  of GAP from its beginning until 1996. In that period
  (until 1997) also Frank Celler has made large contributions to the system.
  Also from the beginning of GAP and until now, Thomas
  Breuer has made large contributions not only to his special area of
  work, namely representation theory in GAP. Steve Linton,
  Alexander Hulpke, and Frank Lübeck have taken over a good deal of
  Martin's rôle since 1997.

<h3>
  Package and data library authors and maintainers
</h3>
<p>
  The scope of the GAP system has also been significantly
  enhanced by the many packages and data libraries that have been provided
  by users of GAP for both, GAP&nbsp;4 and
  GAP&nbsp;3. Since the authors and maintainers of these
  contributions are named with each of the packages or data libraries,
  respectively, we do not keep a separate list of all these names (see
  <a href="/Packages/packages.html">Packages</a>,
  <a href="/Datalib/datalib.html">Data&nbsp;Libraries</a>,
  <a href="/Gap3/Packages3/packages.html">
  GAP&nbsp;3&nbsp;Share&nbsp;Packages</a>, and
  <a href="/Gap3/Datalib3/datalib.html">
  GAP&nbsp;3&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Libraries</a>). 
</p>

<h3>
  Support Group
</h3>
<p>
  Since the first release of GAP there have always been
  some people answering the many questions and requests sent by users
  either to the
  <a href="/Contacts/Forum/forum.html">GAP&nbsp;Forum</a>
  or to  <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a>.
  On a special page we list as the
  GAP <a href="supportgroup.html">Support Group</a>
  the names of those who at present are most involved in this help.
</p>

<h3>
  The GAP Council
</h3>
<p>
  Since 1995 a number of senior mathematicians and computer scientists,
  engaged in a broad spectrum of areas in computational group theory have
  agreed to form a
  '<a href="Council/council.html">GAP&nbsp;Council</a>' that
  in particular functions as an editorial board for external contributions
  to GAP and will advise on broad policy issues in the
  continued development of GAP.
