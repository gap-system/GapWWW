<mixertitle>Contacts: People, Feedback, User Support, and Cooperation
</mixertitle>

<h3>
  People
</h3>
<p>
  A separate page <a href="/Contacts/People/people.html">People</a>
  acknowledges the help given to the <mixer var="GAP"/> project in
  different ways by many colleagues. All of these are refered to as the
  <b>'<mixer var="GAP"/>&nbsp;Group'</b>. To contact the 
  <mixer var="GAP"/> Group by
  email, please use the address
  <mixer person="GAP" data="email_link"/>. For
  ordinary mail use the address <br /><br />
  <mixer person="GAP" data="address"/><br />
  Fax: &nbsp; <mixer person="GAP" data="fax"/>
</p>
<p>
  The <mixer var="GAP"/> Group is most interested in close contact to the
  users of <mixer var="GAP"/>. On one hand we hope for feedback from users,
  on the other hand we are offering to give support to users as well as we
  can. However with both, reacting to feedback and giving support, users
  are kindly asked to understand that all this is done by colleagues who
  provide such service in addition to the work for their regular job.
</p>

<h3>
  Centres
</h3>
<p>
In March 2005 the <mixer var="GAP"/> Council and the 
<mixer var="GAP"/> developers have agreed
that status and  responsibilities of "<mixer var="GAP"/> Headquarters"
should  be passed to  an equal  collaboration of  a number  of 
"<a href="/Contacts/centres.html"><mixer var="GAP"/>&nbsp;Centers</a>".
</p>

<h3>
  Feedback
</h3>
<p>
  We hope for feedback in particular in the following instances.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>When using <mixer var="GAP"/>.</b>&nbsp;
    If you have used <mixer var="GAP"/> we would appreciate some
    information about your work again by an email letter to the  address
    <mixer person="GAP" data="email_link"/>, see also the page on 
    <a href="publicationfeedback.html">Feedback&nbsp;on&nbsp;Use</a>.
    <br />&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>When publishing results.</b>&nbsp;
    Finally, when you publish results obtained in part by using
    <mixer var="GAP"/> we ask that you quote <mixer var="GAP"/>
    (see recommended <a href="/Contacts/cite.html">citation</a>) and
    tell us about your publication again by email to
    <mixer person="GAP" data="email_link"/> since we would like to include 
    a reference to your publication into the 
    <a href="/Doc/Bib/bib.html">Bibliography</a>  about use of 
    <mixer var="GAP"/>.
    <br />&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>When encountering bugs.</b>&nbsp;
    We would extremely appreciate if in case of encountering any bugs in 
    <mixer var="GAP"/> you could inform us as soon as possible. Reporting a bug,
    please follow <a href="trouble.html">these guidelines</a>.
    The preferred way to submit bug reports is to use the
    <a href="https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues">GAP issue tracker</a>
    on GitHub. Alternatively, you may send them to <mixer person="GAP" data="email_link"/>. 
    When using email, please don't attach any log files, suggested patches etc. because 
    this mailing list blocks attachments - put all the text into the body of email instead.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  User Support
</h3>
<p>
  We offer to react as well as we can to questions, requests for help with
  problems, or complaints that you may have. However, for the sake of the
  whole user community of <mixer var="GAP"/>, we ask you to separate these
  into two different categories.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b><mixer var="GAP"/> Support.</b>&nbsp;
    We would like to deal with those topics that are more or less
    local to you, that is, are likely not of interest to most of the
    other <mixer var="GAP"/> users by direct correspondence with you.
    Please send letters about such <b>local</b> problems and questions 
    also to the address  <mixer person="GAP" data="email_link"/>.     
<br />&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><mixer var="GAP"/> Forum.</b>&nbsp;
    On the other hand, the
    <a href="/Contacts/Forum/forum.html"><mixer var="GAP"/>&nbsp;Forum</a>
    should be reserved for discussions about problems that are likely
    to interest many of the <mixer var="GAP"/> users. It would also be
    welcome if you could occasionally tell other users in the
    <mixer var="GAP"/> Forum about interesting applications you have
    made of <mixer var="GAP"/>. All correspondence in the Forum is
    kept in the
    <a href="/Doc/forumarchive.html">Forum&nbsp;Archive</a>.
    <p>
    For <b>theoretical</b> questions on groups and related structures
    we like to point to the 
    <a href=" http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masgcs/gpf.html">Group-Pub-forum</a>
    in which such questions  are answered and discussed by a large 
    community of experts.<br/>
    We provide links to further mathematical fora and to other addresses 
    that we hope to be useful for mathematicians on the page
    <a href="/Contacts/outside.html">'To&nbsp;Outside&nbsp;World'</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Cooperation
</h3>
<p>
  The functionality of <mixer var="GAP"/> has been widely enlarged by
  pieces of code and data collections that have been developed by users
  of <mixer var="GAP"/> and have been provided to be used with the main
  <mixer var="GAP"/> library. We distribute these in the form of
  <a href="/Packages/packages.html">Packages</a>,
  <a href="/Datalib/datalib.html">Data&nbsp;Libraries</a>, and
  <a href="/Packages/Contrib/contrib.html">Deposited&nbsp;Contributions</a>.
  We welcome obtaining any further such contributions as well as references
  to <mixer var="GAP"/> implementations in the course of your research
  projects that you want to keep with you but that you will allow to
  be listed on the page 
  <a href="/Packages/undep.html">Undeposited&nbsp;Implementations</a>.
</p>
<p>
  As explained on the respective page we have established a procedure for
  formally 'accepting' some packages which we hope will give them a status
  comparable to a published paper. On a separate page we inform about the
  process of <a href="submit.html">submitting&nbsp;contributions</a>.
</p>

<h3>
  Funding
</h3>
<p>
  We acknowledge with gratitude the financial support of the development
  of <mixer var="GAP"/> by various
  <a href="funding.html">Funding&nbsp;Bodies</a>.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Finally, <b> <a href="outside.html">To&nbsp;Outside&nbsp;World</a> </b>
gives a  number  of links  that we  hope to  be
occasionally useful to  have at hand for users  of <mixer var="GAP"/>,
although they have nothing directly to do with the system. Most of the
links go  to web sites with lots  of information that we  believe to be
kept reasonably up to date for their respective purpose.
