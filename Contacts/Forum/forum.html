<p>
  We have established a GAP Forum, where interested users
  can discuss GAP related topics by e-mail. In particular
  this Forum is for questions and  comments of <b>general</b> interest
  about GAP.
  We will read this Forum and answer questions and comments. Of course
  others are also invited to answer questions, etc. 
 </p>
 <p>
  If a serious bug is found in the
  sense that it leads to wrong results that cannot be easily recognized as
  such, a report on this bug will be made to the Forum. 
  We will also announce future releases of GAP on this Forum.
</p>
<p>
  So in order to be informed about bugs and their fixes as well as about
  additions to GAP and to be able to take part in discussions
  in the Forum we recommend that you 
  <b>subscribe</b> to the GAP Forum.
</p>

<h3>GAP Support</h3>

<p>
  If you require human help, but your request is likely not to be of interest
  to most other Forum members, please do not write to the GAP
  Forum, but send mail to
</p>
  <pre>
      <mixer person="GAP" data="email_link"/> 
</pre>
<p>
  Also  if you believe you have noticed a bug, please send a 
  <a href="/Contacts/trouble.html">bug&nbsp;report</a> to
  <mixer person="GAP" data="email_link"/>. We will read your report,
  investigate the supposed bug, and inform you of the result of the 
  investigation. If it turns out that indeed you noticed a
  bug it will be fixed and, if it turns out that the bug is serious in the
  sense that it leads to wrong results that cannot be easily recognized as
  such, a report on this bug will be made to the Forum. If possible, a fix
  will be published in the GAP Forum.
</p>

<h3>Other Fora</h3>
<p>
  For <b>theoretical questions</b> on groups and related structures
  we like to point to the 
  <a href=" http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masgcs/gpf.html">Group-Pub-forum</a>
  in which such questions  are answered and discussed by a large 
  community of experts.<br/>
  We provide links to <b>further mathematical fora</b> and to other addresses 
  that we hope to be useful for mathematicians on the page
  <a href="/Contacts/outside.html">'To&nbsp;Outside&nbsp;World'</a>.
