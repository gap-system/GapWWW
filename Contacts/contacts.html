<h3>
  People
</h3>
<p>
  A separate page <a href="/Contacts/People/people.html">People</a>
  acknowledges the help given to the GAP project in
  different ways by many colleagues. All of these are refered to as the
  <b>'GAP&nbsp;Group'</b>. To contact the 
  GAP Group by
  email, please use the address
  <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a>. For
  ordinary mail use the address <br /><br />
  The GAP Group<br>
  Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Computational Algebra<br>
  University of St Andrews<br>
  Mathematical Institute<br>
  North Haugh<br>
  St Andrews, Fife, KY16 9SS<br>
  UK<br>
</p>
<p>
  The GAP Group is most interested in close contact to the
  users of GAP. On one hand we hope for feedback from users,
  on the other hand we are offering to give support to users as well as we
  can. However with both, reacting to feedback and giving support, users
  are kindly asked to understand that all this is done by colleagues who
  provide such service in addition to the work for their regular job.
</p>

<h3>
  Centres
</h3>
<p>
In March 2005 the GAP Council and the 
GAP developers have agreed
that status and  responsibilities of "GAP Headquarters"
should  be passed to  an equal  collaboration of  a number  of 
"<a href="/Contacts/centres.html">GAP&nbsp;Centers</a>".
</p>

<h3>
  Feedback
</h3>
<p>
  We hope for feedback in particular in the following instances.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>When using GAP.</b>&nbsp;
    If you have used GAP we would appreciate some
    information about your work again by an email letter to the  address
    <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a>, see also the page on 
    <a href="publicationfeedback.html">Feedback&nbsp;on&nbsp;Use</a>.
    <br />&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>When publishing results.</b>&nbsp;
    Finally, when you publish results obtained in part by using
    GAP we ask that you quote GAP
    (see recommended <a href="/Contacts/cite.html">citation</a>) and
    tell us about your publication again by email to
    <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a> since we would like to include 
    a reference to your publication into the 
    <a href="/Doc/Bib/bib.html">Bibliography</a>  about use of 
    GAP.
    <br />&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>When encountering bugs.</b>&nbsp;
    We would extremely appreciate if in case of encountering any bugs in 
    GAP you could inform us as soon as possible. Reporting a bug,
    please follow <a href="trouble.html">these guidelines</a>.
    The preferred way to submit bug reports is to use the
    <a href="https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues">GAP issue tracker</a>
    on GitHub. Alternatively, you may send them to <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a>. 
    When using email, please don't attach any log files, suggested patches etc. because 
    this mailing list blocks attachments - put all the text into the body of email instead.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  User Support
</h3>
<p>
  We offer to react as well as we can to questions, requests for help with
  problems, or complaints that you may have. However, for the sake of the
  whole user community of GAP, we ask you to separate these
  into two different categories.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>GAP Support.</b>&nbsp;
    We would like to deal with those topics that are more or less
    local to you, that is, are likely not of interest to most of the
    other GAP users by direct correspondence with you.
    Please send letters about such <b>local</b> problems and questions 
    also to the address  <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a>.     
<br />&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>GAP Forum.</b>&nbsp;
    On the other hand, the
    <a href="/Contacts/Forum/forum.html">GAP&nbsp;Forum</a>
    should be reserved for discussions about problems that are likely
    to interest many of the GAP users. It would also be
    welcome if you could occasionally tell other users in the
    GAP Forum about interesting applications you have
    made of GAP. All correspondence in the Forum is
    kept in the
    <a href="/Doc/forumarchive.html">Forum&nbsp;Archive</a>.
    <p>
    For <b>theoretical</b> questions on groups and related structures
    we like to point to the 
    <a href=" http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masgcs/gpf.html">Group-Pub-forum</a>
    in which such questions  are answered and discussed by a large 
    community of experts.<br/>
    We provide links to further mathematical fora and to other addresses 
    that we hope to be useful for mathematicians on the page
    <a href="/Contacts/outside.html">'To&nbsp;Outside&nbsp;World'</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Cooperation
</h3>
<p>
  The functionality of GAP has been widely enlarged by
  pieces of code and data collections that have been developed by users
  of GAP and have been provided to be used with the main
  GAP library. We distribute these in the form of
  <a href="/Packages/packages.html">Packages</a>,
  <a href="/Datalib/datalib.html">Data&nbsp;Libraries</a>, and
  <a href="/Packages/Contrib/contrib.html">Deposited&nbsp;Contributions</a>.
  We welcome obtaining any further such contributions as well as references
  to GAP implementations in the course of your research
  projects that you want to keep with you but that you will allow to
  be listed on the page 
  <a href="/Packages/undep.html">Undeposited&nbsp;Implementations</a>.
</p>
<p>
  As explained on the respective page we have established a procedure for
  formally 'accepting' some packages which we hope will give them a status
  comparable to a published paper. On a separate page we inform about the
  process of <a href="submit.html">submitting&nbsp;contributions</a>.
</p>

<h3>
  Funding
</h3>
<p>
  We acknowledge with gratitude the financial support of the development
  of GAP by various
  <a href="funding.html">Funding&nbsp;Bodies</a>.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Finally, <b> <a href="outside.html">To&nbsp;Outside&nbsp;World</a> </b>
gives a  number  of links  that we  hope to  be
occasionally useful to  have at hand for users  of GAP,
although they have nothing directly to do with the system. Most of the
links go  to web sites with lots  of information that we  believe to be
kept reasonably up to date for their respective purpose.
