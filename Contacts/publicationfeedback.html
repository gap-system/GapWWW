<p>
  If you use the Computer Algebra System GAP in your 
  research or teaching, please tell
  us about such use. We are interested to see how GAP is used
  for instance in order to plan the further development of the system.
  Please write an ordinary e-mail letter to 
  <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a>.  
</p>
<p>
We would  appreciate if  you could give  your name,  organisation, and
your email  address and tell us  about your area of  interest and your
work using GAP.  In particular we are interested in the
bibliographic data of papers citing GAP (if any), which
we would like to include into  the 
<a href="/Doc/Bib/bib.html">Bibliography</a> of such papers kept by
us.
</p>
<p>
  If you think that your work may be of broader interest to other users
  of GAP we encourage you even to send a report on it to
  the <a href="/Contacts/Forum/forum.html">GAP Forum</a>.
