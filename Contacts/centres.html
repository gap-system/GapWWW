<p>

In March  2005  the GAP Council  and  the 
GAP developers have agreed
that status and  responsibilities of "GAP Headquarters"
should  be passed to  an equal  collaboration of  a number  of 
"GAP Centres", where there is permanent staff involvement 
and an element  of  collective  or  organisational  commitment, while 
fully recognising the vital contributions  of many individuals outside 
those Centres.

</p>
<p>
The Centres  will work together, with outside  individuals, to sustain
and  develop GAP,  concentrating  in  particular  on
coordination  and on those  tasks which  are not  naturally a  part of
anyone's  research   programme,  but  are  needed   "for  the  general
good".  Some examples  of  possible tasks  are  listed below,  loosely
grouped into areas.
</p>
<p>
To  these ends,  the Centres  may set  up Working  Groups, made  up as
appropriate of  Centre representatives and/or  invited individuals, to
perform particular tasks and reach decisions on particular questions.
</p>

At the present time (March 2005), GAP Centres in the
following places have agreed to cooperate in this way:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/LDFM/">Aachen</a>,
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/icm/algebra/">Braunschweig</a>,
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~hulpke/CGT/CGT.html">Fort&nbsp;Collins</a>, and 
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/">St Andrews</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This list may change, if new Centres emerge, or existing ones withdraw.
</p>

<p>
Representatives  of all  the Centres  can be  contacted via  the usual
support email  address support@gap-system.org.
