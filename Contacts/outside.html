On  this page  we will  give a  number  of links  that we  hope to  be
occasionally useful to  have at hand for users  of GAP,
although they have nothing directly to do with the system. Most of the
links go  to web sites with lots  of information that we  believe to be
kept reasonably up to date for their respective purpose.

<h3>
General.
</h3>

<p>
A potentially useful site is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory">wikipedia</a> site.
A fine history can be found at the 
<a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Abstract_groups/">
St. Andrews</a> site. Further 
general information  can be found via the websites of mathematical societies
and discussion forums. Also 
<a href="https://math.ubbcluj.ro/~marcus/">
Andrei&nbsp;Marcus'&nbsp;Homepage</a>
contains a rich collection of links to mathematics on the web and 
in particular to personal homepages of group theoreticians. 
</p>

<h3>
Mathematical and other Societies.
</h3>

<p>
The St Andrews 'History of Mathematics' web site by J. O'Connor and 
E. Robertson contains an
<a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Societies/">
Alphabetical&nbsp;List&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mathematical&nbsp;Societies</a>
as well as a 
<a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Societies/societies_list/">
Chronological List of Mathematical Societies</a>.
For each Society/Academy listed, there is a link to a page describing its
history and at the bottom of that page you find a link to the home page  
of the respective  Society/Academy  (where it is still current).
</p>
<p>
For convenience we give direct links to the home pages of  a few Societies:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.mathunion.org/">International Mathematical Union (IMU)</a>,
  </li>
  <li> 
<a href="http://www.emis.de/">European Mathematical Society (EMS)</a>,
  </li>
  <li> 
<a href="https://www.ams.org/">American Mathematical Society (AMS)</a>,
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.mathematik.de/">German Mathematical Society (DMV)</a>,
in particular its 
<a href="https://fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de">Fachgruppe Computeralgebra</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.lms.ac.uk/">London Mathematical Society (LMS)</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Also see the home page of the
<a href="https://www.acm.org/">Association for computing Machinery</a>
(ACM) and its
<a href="https://www.sigsam.org/">Special Interest Group in Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation</a>
(ACM SIGSAM).
</p> 

<h3> 
Conferences 
</h3>

<p>
A general overview can be found in the 
<a href="https://www.ams.org/mathcal/">AMS&nbsp;Conference&nbsp;Calendar</a>.
<br/>
The meetings at the   <a href="https://www.mfo.de/">
'Mathematisches&nbsp;Forschungsinstitut&nbsp;Oberwolfach'</a> 
can be found using the links on their homepage.
<br/>

A
<a href="https://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/events/conferences/">
Collection&nbsp;of&nbsp;Meetings</a>
with relation to Group theory, related topics and in particular 
Computational Group Theory  is maintained in St Andrews.  
</p>

<h3>
Fora
</h3>

<p>
There are several adresses for discussion of mathematical questions. 
<br/><br/>
In the 
<a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/masgcs/gpf.html">Group&nbsp;Pub&nbsp;Forum</a>
you have a good chance to get answers to theoretical questions from
<b> group theory</b> and related topics.
<br/> 
The web page
<a href="http://listserv.nodak.edu/archives/nmbrthry.html">
http://listserv.nodak.edu/archives/nmbrthry.html</a> has instructions on how
to subscribe, send a mail, etc. to a <b>Number Theory List</b>.
<br/>
Each of these websites also provides lots of general information.
<br/>
There are also <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gap">Mathematics</a>
and <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/tagged/gap">MathOverflow</a> sites which are
part of the <a href="https://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> network
of Q&amp;A (question and answer) sites.

<h3>
People from History and Today.
</h3>

<p>
The St Andrews  
<a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/">
'History&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mathematics'</a> web site by J. O'Connor and 
E. Robertson collects cvs of many mathematicians from the past and 
of a few outstanding ones of today.
<br/>
The  <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu">
Mathematics&nbsp;Genealogy&nbsp;Project</a> answers the question 
'Who was who's PhD thesis  advisor?' far back into history.
</p>

<h3>
Reviews and Preprints
</h3>

<p> 
<a href="https://www.ams.org/mathscinet">MathSciNet</a>  is a comprehensive
database covering the world's mathematical literature since 1940.
It provides Web access to the bibliographic data and reviews of 
mathematical research literature contained in the 
Mathematical Reviews Database and fosters the navigation of mathematics 
literature by providing links to original articles and other original 
documents, when available.

</p>

<p> Its competitor,
<a  href="https://zbmath.org/">Zentralblatt&nbsp;MATH</a> is the
world's most  complete and  longest running abstracting  and reviewing
service  in  pure  and  applied mathematics.   The  Zentralblatt  MATH
Database contains more  than 2.0 million entries drawn  from more than
2300 serials and journals and covers the period from 1868 - present by
the recent  integration of the  Jahrbuch database (JFM).   The entries
are  classified according  to the  Mathematics  Subject Classification
Scheme (MSC 2000).  
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/">arXiv</a>
is an e-print service in the fields of physics, mathematics, 
non-linear science, computer science, and quantitative biology, operated 
by Cornell University.
