<h3>1 <span class="Heading">Preface</span></h3>

<p>Welcome to <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. This is one of the manuals documenting the core part of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, the others being the <em><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> Tutorial</em> (see <a href="../../doc/tut/chap1_mj.html#X874E1D45845007FE"><span class="RefLink">Tutorial: Preface</span></a>) and <em>HPC-GAP Reference Manual</em>.</p>

<p>There is also a document <code class="file">CHANGES.md</code> on the changes from earlier versions in the root directory. This preface serves not only to introduce "The <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> Reference Manual", but also as an introduction to the whole system.</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> stands for <em>Groups, Algorithms and Programming</em>. The name was chosen to reflect the original aim of the system, which is introduced in this reference manual. Since that choice, the system has become somewhat broader, and you will also find information about algorithms and programming for other algebraic structures, such as semigroups and algebras.</p>

<p>This manual, the <em><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> Reference Manual</em> contains the official definitions of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> functions. It should contain all the information needed to use <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, and is not intended to be read cover-to-cover.</p>

<p>To get started a new user may first look at parts of the <em><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> Tutorial</em> (see <a href="../../doc/tut/chap1_mj.html#X874E1D45845007FE"><span class="RefLink">Tutorial: Preface</span></a>).</p>

<p>A lot of the functionality of the system and a number of contributed extensions are provided as "<strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> packages" which are developed independently of the core part of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and can be loaded into a <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> session. Each package comes with a its own manual which is also available through the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> help system.</p>

<p>This manual is divided into chapters, sections and subsections. Chapter <a href="chap2_mj.html#X8755A2C67B197C63"><span class="RefLink">2</span></a> describes the <em>help system</em>, which provides access to all the manuals from a running <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> session. Chapter <a href="chap3_mj.html#X79CCD3A6821E5A37"><span class="RefLink">3</span></a> gives technical advice for <em>running</em> <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. Chapter <a href="chap4_mj.html#X7FE7C0C17E1ED118"><span class="RefLink">4</span></a> introduces the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> language, and the next chapters deal with the <em>environment</em> provided by <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> for the user. These are followed by the main bulk of chapters which are devoted to the various mathematical structures that <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> can handle.</p>

<p>Subsequent sections of this preface explain the structure of the system and provide copyright and licensing information.</p>

<h4>1.1 <span class="Heading">The <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> System</span></h4>

<p><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is a <em>free</em>, <em>open</em> and <em>extensible</em> software package for computation in discrete abstract algebra. The terms "free" and "open" describe the conditions under which the system is distributed -- in brief, it is <em>free of charge</em> (except possibly for the immediate costs of delivering it to you), you are <em>free to pass it on</em> within certain limits, and all of the workings of the system are <em>open for you to examine and change</em>. Details of these conditions can be found in Section <span class="RefLink">Reference: Copyright and License</span>.</p>

<p>The system is "extensible" in that you can write your own programs in the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> language, and use them in just the same way as the programs which form part of the system (the "library"). Indeed, we actively support the contribution, refereeing and distribution of extensions to the system, in the form of "<strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> packages". Further details of this can be found in Chapter <span class="RefLink">Reference: Using and Developing GAP Packages</span>, and on our website.</p>

<p>Development of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> began at Lehrstuhl D für Mathematik, RWTH-Aachen, under the leadership of Joachim Neubüser in 1985. Version 2.4 was released in 1988 and version 3.1 in 1992. In 1997 coordination of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> development, now very much an international effort, was transferred to St Andrews. A complete internal redesign and almost complete rewrite of the system was completed over the following years and version 4.1 was released in July 1999. A sign of the further internationalization of the project was the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4.4 release in 2004, which has been coordinated from Colorado State University, Fort Collins.</p>

<p>More information on the motivation and development of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> to date, can be found on our website in a section entitled "Some History of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>": <span class="URL"><a href="https://www.gap-system.org/Doc/History/history.html">https://www.gap-system.org/Doc/History/history.html</a></span>.</p>

<p>For those readers who have used an earlier version of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, an overview of the changes from <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4.4 and a brief summary of changes from earlier versions is given in <code class="file">CHANGES.md</code> file in the main directory.</p>

<p>The system that you are getting now consists of a "core system" and a number of packages. The core system consists of four main parts.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A <em>kernel</em>, written in C, which provides the user with</p>


<ul>
<li><p>automatic dynamic storage management, which the user needn't bother about when programming;</p>

</li>
<li><p>a set of time-critical basic functions, e.g. "arithmetic", operations for integers, finite fields, permutations and words, as well as natural operations for lists and records;</p>

</li>
<li><p>an interpreter for the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> language, an untyped imperative programming language with functions as first class objects and some extra built-in data types such as permutations and finite field elements. The language supports a form of object-oriented programming, similar to that supported by languages like C++ and Java but with some important differences.</p>

</li>
<li><p>a small set of system functions allowing the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> programmer to handle files and execute external programs in a uniform way, regardless of the particular operating system in use.</p>

</li>
<li><p>a set of programming tools for testing, debugging, and timing algorithms.</p>

</li>
<li><p>a "read-eval-view" style user interface.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A much larger <em>library of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> functions</em> that implement algebraic and other algorithms. Since this is written entirely in the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> language, the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> language is both the main implementation language and the user language of the system. Therefore a user can, as easily as the original programmers, investigate and vary algorithms of the library and add new ones to it, first for their own use and eventually for the benefit of all <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> users.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A <em>library of group theoretical data</em> which contains various libraries of groups, including the library of small groups (containing all groups of order at most 2000, except those of order 1024) and others. Large libraries of ordinary and Brauer character tables and Tables of Marks are included as packages.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <em>documentation</em>. This is available as on-line help, as printable files in PDF format and as HTML for viewing with a Web browser.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Also included with the core system are some test files and a few small utilities which we hope you will find useful.</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> <em>packages</em> are self-contained extensions to the core system. A package contains <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> code and its own documentation and may also contain data files or external programs to which the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> code provides an interface. These packages may be loaded into <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> using the <code class="func">LoadPackage</code> (<span class="RefLink">Reference: LoadPackage</span>) command, and both the package and its documentation are then available just as if they were parts of the core system. Some packages may be loaded automatically, when <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is started, if they are present. Some packages, because they depend on external programs, may only be available on the operating systems where those programs are available (usually UNIX). You should note that, while the packages included with this release are the most recent versions ready for release at this time, new packages and new versions may be released at any time and can be easily installed in your copy of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>.</p>

<p>With <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> there are two packages (the library of ordinary and Brauer character tables, and the library of tables of marks) which contain functionality developed from parts of the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> core system. These have been moved into packages for ease of maintenance and to allow new versions to be released independently of new releases of the core system. The library of small groups should also be regarded as a package, although it does not currently use the standard package mechanism. Other packages contain functionality which has never been part of the core system, and may extend it substantially, implementing specific algorithms to enhance its capabilities, providing data libraries, interfaces to other computer algebra systems and data sources such as the electronic version of the Atlas of Finite Group Representations; therefore, installation and usage of packages is recommended.</p>

<p>Further details about <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> packages can be found in chapter <span class="RefLink">Reference: Using and Developing GAP Packages</span>, and on the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> website here: <span class="URL"><a href="https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html">https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html</a></span>.</p>

<h4>1.2 <span class="Heading">Authors and Maintainers</span></h4>

<p><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is the work of very many people, many of whom still maintain parts of the system. A complete list of authors, and an approximation to the current list of maintainers can be found on the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> website at <span class="URL"><a href="https://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/authors.html">https://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/authors.html</a></span> and <span class="URL"><a href="https://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/modules.html">https://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/modules.html</a></span>. All <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> packages have their own authors and maintainers. It should however be noted that some packages provide interfaces between <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and an external program, a copy of which is included for convenience, and that, in these cases, we do not claim that the package authors or maintainers wrote, or maintain, this external program. Similarly, the system and some packages include large data libraries that may have been computed by many people. We try to make clear in each case what credit is attributable to whom.</p>

<p>We have, for some time, operated a refereeing system for contributed packages, both to ensure the quality of the software we distribute, and to provide recognition for the authors. We now consider this to be a refereeing system for modules, and we would note, in particular that, although it does not use the standard package interface, the library of small groups has been refereed and accepted on exactly the same basis as the accepted packages.</p>

<p>We also include with this distribution a number of packages which have not (yet) gone through our refereeing process. Some may be accepted in the future, in other cases the authors have chosen not to submit them. More information can be found on our website (see Section <a href="chap1_mj.html#X7BF552C07E2F8F7C"><span class="RefLink">1.5</span></a>).</p>

<h4>1.3 <span class="Heading">Acknowledgements</span></h4>

<p>Very many people have worked on, and contributed to, <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> over the years since its inception. On our website you will find the prefaces to the previous releases, each of which acknowledges people who have made special contributions to that release. Even so, it is appropriate to mention here Joachim Neubüser whose vision of a free, open and extensible system for computational algebra inspired <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> in the first place, and Martin Schönert, who was the technical architect of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 3 and <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4.</p>
