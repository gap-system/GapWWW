The GAP package CaratInterface provides GAP interface routines to
some of the stand-alone programs in the package CARAT, developed
by J. Opgenorth, W. Plesken, and  T. Schulz at Lehrstuhl B für
Mathematik, RWTH Aachen. CARAT is a package for the computation
with crystallographic groups. It is implemented in C, and thus needs
to be compiled. It currently runs on Unix systems and in Unix-like
environments.

CARAT is to a large extent complementary to the GAP package Cryst.
In particular, it provides routines for the computation of
normalizers and conjugators of finite unimodular groups in GL(n,Z),
and routines for the computation of Bravais groups, which are all
missing in Cryst. Furthermore, it provides also a catalogue of
Bravais groups up to dimension 6. Cryst automatically loads
CaratInterface when it is available, and makes use of its functions
where necessary. The CaratInterface package together with CARAT
thereby extends the functionality of the package Cryst considerably.

The CaratInterface routines have been written by
