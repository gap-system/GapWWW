      README file for the `EDIM' mini GAP4 package (Frank Lübeck)
        
To get the newest version of this  GAP 4 package download one of the archive
files
    EDIM-x.x.tar.gz
    EDIM-x.x.tar.bz2
    EDIM-x.x-win.zip      (with text files in DOS/Windows format)
and unpack it using 
    gunzip EDIM-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf EDIM-x.x.tar
respectively
    unzip EDIM-x.x-win.zip
and so on.

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your  GAP   4   installation. It  creates a    subdirectory  called
'EDIM-x.y.z'. 

To install this package do

    cd EDIM-*
    /bin/sh ./configure [path] 

where  `path' is a path to  the GAP build  directory (if not given
the default `../..' is assumed).

In version of GAP <4.9 a further argument
      CONFIGNAME=...
can be used to describe the configuration name of GAP for which you want 
to compile (if not given "default64" or "default32" are used).

Afterwards call `make'  to  compile  a binary file. 
 
The package  will  also work without  this  step  but then the  kernel
function `ElementaryDivisorsPPartRkExpSmall' will not be available.

Recompiling the documentation is possible  by the command 
     gap makedocrel.g   
in the EDIM directory (edit 'relpath' in this file, if EDIM is not installed
in the standard location, otherwise this should not be necessary).

You can also run a test of the installation by 'make test'.

You must load EDIM with the command 
     gap> LoadPackage("EDIM");
within your GAP session to use its functionality. 

E-mail me if  there are any questions,  remarks,  suggestions. Also, I
would like to hear about applications of this package.

Alternatively, there is a public repository with issue tracker
