# The GAP 4 package 'XMod' 

## Introduction 

This package allows for computation with crossed modules; cat1-groups; morphisms of these structures; derivations of crossed modules and the corresponding sections of cat1-groups.

In October 2015 a new section on isoclinism of crossed modules was added. 

Experimental functions for crossed squares and cat2-groups are now included.
