Installing the DESIGN Package
-----------------------------

The DESIGN package is included in the standard GAP distribution. You
only need to download and install DESIGN if you need to install
the package locally or are installing an upgrade of DESIGN to an
existing installation of GAP (see the main GAP reference section
"ref:Installing a GAP Package").  If you do need to download DESIGN,
you can find archive files for the package in various formats at
<https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/design.html>, and then your archive
file of choice should be downloaded and unpacked in the `pkg' subdirectory
of an appropriate GAP root directory (see the main GAP reference section
"ref:GAP Root Directories").

The DESIGN package is written entirely in GAP code, and requires
no further installation.  However, the DESIGN package has complete
functionality only in an environment in which the GRAPE package is
fully installed.
