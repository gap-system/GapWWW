The GAP 4 package `profiling'
==============================

This package provides line-by-line profiling of GAP, allowing
both discovering which lines of code take the most time, and
which lines of code are even executed.

The main function provided by this package is
OutputAnnotatedCodeCoverageFiles, which takes a previously
generated profile (using ProfileLineByLine or CoverageLineByLine,
both provided by the GAP library), and outputs human-readable
HTML files.

There is also OutputFlameGraph, which outputs a graphical diagram
showing which functions took the most time during exection.

you can use the following notation to tell configure where GAP
is located.

./configure --with-gaproot=<location of GAP root>
make
