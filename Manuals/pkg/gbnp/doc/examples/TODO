Not urgent:
- Make an example with cancellative monoids and trace
- example 3 Is it possible to find modules (Reflection modules) e_i s_i= - e_i
 e_i s_j= e_i (e_i perp s_j) or e_i s_j = e_i+e_j (i<>j and e_i not perp s_j)
- example 14 -> E7 (?)

URGENT:
- Times on what system for ex 14

- Example 24.g SGrobnerTrace  outputs e-a which should have been e-1
  not good enough sNormalForm? SGrobner on the other hand works well

- Removed obsolete parts from lib??  There seem to be noew versions
  in grobnerloop2.gi


DONE: 
- comment example10
