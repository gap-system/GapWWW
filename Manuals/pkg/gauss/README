    README file for the `Gauss' GAP4 package
        
To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download the archive
file
    Gauss.tar.gz
and unpack it using 
    tar xvf Gauss.tar.gz

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `Gauss'.

The Gauss package utilizes some C-code by Max Neunhoeffer that has to
be compiled before you can load Gauss. To compile the code, first run

    ./configure

If the package is not installed in the pkg/ subdirectory of GAP's root
directory you will need to provide the correct path to the latter. This will
create a makefile. Complete the installation of the package by running

    make

Testing the package is possible by invoking

ReadPackage( "Gauss", "maketest.g" );

from within GAP.

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I
would like to hear about applications of this package.
