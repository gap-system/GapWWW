# AutoDoc: A GAP package to help creating a GAPDoc documentation.

AutoDoc is a package for the [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org) computer
algebra system. It is meant to simplify the creation of reference manuals for
GAP packages. It makes it possible to create documentation from source code
comments, without writing XML files. It is not a substitute for GAPDoc, but
rather builds on GAPDoc, by generating XML input for the latter. As such, you
can combine an existing GAPDoc manual with AutoDoc.


## Using AutoDoc

Please consult the AutoDoc manual for information on how to use it. It is
accessible via the builtin help system of GAP. In addition you can find the
manual for the latest AutoDoc version online at
  <https://gap-packages.github.io/AutoDoc/doc/chap0.html>
