# FORMAT -- GAP package for computing with formations

This is the README file for the GAP4 package FORMAT 
by Bettina Eick and Charles R.B. Wright. 

The package contains programs for computing with formations 
of finite solvable groups and with various formation-theoretic 
subgroups.


## Running the package

No special preparation is required. Simply move the format directory to
the GAP `pkg` directory, start GAP and use the command
`LoadPackage("format")` to load the programs into GAP.


## Examples

The subdirectory `grp' contains various examples of pc groups. They
can be used as examples for applications of the package.
