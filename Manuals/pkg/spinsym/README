To install the newest version of this package download the archive file

    spinsym-1.5.2.tar.gz	

and unpack it inside the `pkg' subdirectory of your GAP4 installation, 
e.g. using 

    tar xvzf spinsym-1.5.2.tar.gz

It creates a subdirectory called `spinsym'.

To use the package just start GAP and type

    LoadPackage("spinsym");

The `SpinSym' package banner should appear on the screen. 

For a listing and description of the user functions see the package 
documentation in the `doc' subdirectory (e.g. the file manual.pdf).

To run some tests type

   dir:= DirectoriesPackageLibrary( "spinsym", "tst" )[1];
   tst:= Filename( dir, "testall.tst" );
   Test( tst );

which will (hopefully) return `true'.
