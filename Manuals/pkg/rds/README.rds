	--------------------------------------------

RDS is a package for the search for relative difference set in
(nonabelian) finite groups. The manual is contained in the directory

The RDS package is completely written in GAP.

Please send bug reports to roeder.marc@gmail.com

       	    	Requirements
		-----------

RDS requires GAP version >=4.5 and L. Soicher's DESIGN package version
>=1.3 (which in turn depends on the GRAPE package).


		Installation
		---------

1. Download one of the archives

	rds<ver>.tar.bz2 
	rds<ver>.tar.gz
	rds<ver>.zoo
	rds<ver>-win.zip

   (where <ver> is some version number) to the directory pkg/ of the 
   GAP home directory. If you do not have permission to do so, create 
   a directory called gap/pkg in your home directory.


2. change directory to pkg/ and unpack the archive using the according command:

	tar -xjf rds<ver>.tar.bz2
	tar -xzf rds<ver>.tar.gz
	zoo -extract rds<ver>.zoo 
	unzip rds<ver>-win.zip

 (replace <ver> with the version number)

3. start GAP. If you have created the directory gap/pkg in your home 
   directory, use "gap -l '<homedir>/gap;'" where <homedir> is the path of
   your home directory (use "pwd" to find out what it is, if you don't know)

4. Type "LoadPackage("rds");" to load the RDS package
