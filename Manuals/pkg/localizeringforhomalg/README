    README file for the `LocalizeRingForHomalg' GAP4 package
        
To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download one of the
archive files
    LocalizeRingForHomalg-x.x.tar.gz
    LocalizeRingForHomalg-x.x.tar.bz2
    LocalizeRingForHomalg-x.x.zip
and unpack it using 
    tar xvf LocalizeRingForHomalg-x.x.tar.gz
respectively
    unzip LocalizeRingForHomalg-x.x.zip

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `LocalizeRingForHomalg'.

This completes the installation of the package.

Testing the package is possible by invoking

ReadPackage( "LocalizeRingForHomalg", "maketest.g" );

from within GAP.

You need the computer algebra system Singular (version >= 3-0-4)
to run the tests.

You also need the packages IO_ForHomalg, RingsForHomalg, and Modules
from the homalg project to run the test.
You can download them from:

E-mail us if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, we
would like to hear about applications of this package.
