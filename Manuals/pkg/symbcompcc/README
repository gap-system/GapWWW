               The Symbolic-Computation-and-Coclass package

This is the README file for the GAP package "SymbCompCC".

This package gives tools to compute with elements in Q[p^x]. These 
elements are used to give parameter presentations for p-groups of certain 
coclass and the computation of the Schur extension of these families of 
groups. 

The  package is distributed with  the main  GAP archive.  
For updates check the package Web page
     https://gap-packages.github.io/SymbCompCC/
  
An installation should be possible on any system. You have to unpack the
package into the GAP-package directory pkg. 

Now start GAP and type

  LoadPackage("SymbCompCC");

The ``SymbCompCC" package banner should appear on the screen. 

For details on how to use the SymbCompCC package see the package
documentation in the `doc' subdirectory (view either `manual.dvi'  via
`xdvi' or or `manual.pdf' via a PDF viewer).
