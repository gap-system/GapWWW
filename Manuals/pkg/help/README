    README file for the `HeLP' GAP4 package
        



To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download one of the
archive files
    HeLP-x.x.tar.gz



and unpack it using 
    gunzip HeLP-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf HeLP-x.x.tar.




(Note that if you use a browser like `netscape' for downloading the
archive file the `gunzip' step above may already be done by the browser,
although the name of your file may still have the misleading `.gz'
extension.)

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `help'.

 The package uses the software 4ti2 <Cite Key="4ti2"/> and/or normaliz and hence is only properly working
 on systems which have at least one of the two installed. normaliz
 may be installed via the GAP-package NormalizInterface,
 see the documentaion of this package for details.
 For more information on 4ti2 and to download it, please visit
 <URL Text="www.4ti2.de">http://www.4ti2.de</URL>. 
 To interact with these external softwares the package makes use of the
 4ti2-Interface and normaliz-Interface written by S. Gutsche, C. Söger and M. Horn, 
 The 4ti2-Interface in turn uses the package IO, that needs a C-part to be compiled;
 see the readme-file or the documentation of the IO-package for details.

This completes the installation of the package.

E-mail us if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, we
would like to hear about applications of this package.
