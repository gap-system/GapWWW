      README file for the GAP4 package SONATA



To install SONATA, unpack the archive inside the `pkg' subdirectory of
your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `sonata'.

Then start GAP and load SONATA with the command

LoadPackage("sonata");

In addition to the standard GAP help, we have produced a tutorial for 
SONATA, which can be found in the subdirectory doc/tut/ of the sonata 
package.

E-mail us if  there are any questions,  remarks,  suggestions. Also, we
would like to hear about applications of this package.
