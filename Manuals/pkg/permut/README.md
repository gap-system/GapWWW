# PERMUT: a GAP4 package to deal with permutability

The package `permut` contains some functions to deal with
permutability in finite groups.

## Installation 
To install this package, just decompress the file `permut-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`
in a directory in the `pkg` hierarchy of the GAP installation, where
`X.Y.Z` is the version number. It requires the package `format` to be
previously installed. Use then

`  LoadPackage("permut");`

to load it.
GAP 4.7.4 or later is required.
Inside GAP, help can be obtained by using

`  ?permut:`

The `tst/` directory contains the file permut.tst which can be used to
test the installation. In the `doc/` directory, the file `manual.pdf`
contains the manual in PDF format. The HTML version starting page is
the file `chap0.html` of the `doc/` directory.

This package is distributed with GAP, but you can always get the latest
version from the [permut web page](https://gap-packages.github.io/permut).
