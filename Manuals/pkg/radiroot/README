                  ============================


Abilities:
---------

The package can compute and display an expression by radicals for the roots of
a solvable, rational polynomial.
Related to this it is possible to create the Galois group and the splitting
field of a rational polynomial.

Requirements:
------------

The package is written for GAP version 4.7 or higher. It requires the package
'Alnuth' in version 3.0 or higher.

License:
--------

The 'RadiRoot' package is free software and can be redistributed and/or
modified under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
For details see the file GPL.

Installation:

The installation follows standard GAP rules.
So the normal way to install is to unpack the archive in the `pkg'
directory, which will create a subdirectory `radiroot'.
