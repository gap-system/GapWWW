<h3>1 <span class="Heading">
      Introduction
    </span></h3>

<p>A <em>numerical semigroup</em> is a subset of the set <span class="SimpleMath">N</span> of nonnegative integers that is closed under addition, contains <span class="SimpleMath">0</span> and whose complement in <span class="SimpleMath">N</span> is finite. The smallest positive integer belonging to a numerical semigroup is its <em>multiplicity</em>.</p>

<p>Let <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> be a numerical semigroup and <span class="SimpleMath">A</span> be a subset of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span>. We say that <span class="SimpleMath">A</span> is a <em>system of generators</em> of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> if <span class="SimpleMath">S={ k_1 a_1+⋯+ k_n a_n | n,k_1,...,k_n∈ N, a_1,...,a_n∈ A}</span>. The set <span class="SimpleMath">A</span> is a <em>minimal system of generators</em> of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> if no proper subset of <span class="SimpleMath">A</span> is a system of generators of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span>.</p>

<p>Every numerical semigroup has a unique minimal system of generators. This is a data that can be used in order to uniquely define a numerical semigroup. Observe that since the complement of a numerical semigroup in the set of nonnegative integers is finite, this implies that the greatest common divisor of the elements of a numerical semigroup is 1, and the same condition must be fulfilled by its minimal system of generators (or by any of its systems of generators).</p>

<p>Given a numerical semigroup <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> and a nonzero element <span class="SimpleMath">s</span> in it, one can consider for every integer <span class="SimpleMath">i</span> ranging from <span class="SimpleMath">0</span> to <span class="SimpleMath">s-1</span>, the smallest element in <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> congruent with <span class="SimpleMath">i</span> modulo <span class="SimpleMath">s</span>, say <span class="SimpleMath">w(i)</span> (this element exists since the complement of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> in <span class="SimpleMath">N</span> is finite). Clearly <span class="SimpleMath">w(0)=0</span>. The set <span class="SimpleMath">Ap(S,s)={ w(0),w(1),..., w(s-1)}</span> is called the <em>Apéry set</em> of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> with respect to <span class="SimpleMath">s</span>. Note that a nonnegative integer <span class="SimpleMath">x</span> congruent with <span class="SimpleMath">i</span> modulo <span class="SimpleMath">s</span> belongs to <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> if and only if <span class="SimpleMath">w(i)≤ x</span>. Thus the pair <span class="SimpleMath">(s, Ap(S,s))</span> fully determines the numerical semigroup <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> (and can be used to easily solve the membership problem to <span class="SimpleMath">S</span>). This set is in fact one of the most powerfull tools known for numerical semigroups, and it is used almost everywhere in the computation of components and invariants associated to a numerical semigroup. Usually the element <span class="SimpleMath">s</span> is taken to be the multiplicity, since in this way the resulting Apéry set is the smallest possible.</p>

<p>A <em>gap</em> of a numerical semigroup <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is a nonnegative integer not belonging to <span class="SimpleMath">S</span>. The set of gaps of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is usually denoted by <span class="SimpleMath">H(S)</span>, and clearly determines uniquely <span class="SimpleMath">S</span>. Note that if <span class="SimpleMath">x</span> is a gap of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span>, then so are all the nonnegative integers dividing it. Thus in order to describe <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> we do not need to know all its gaps, but only those that are maximal with respect to the partial order induced by division in <span class="SimpleMath">N</span>. These gaps are called <em>fundamental gaps</em>.</p>

<p>The largest nonnegative integer not belonging to a numerical semigroup <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is the <em>Frobenius number</em> of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span>. If <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is the set of nonnegative integers, then clearly its Frobenius number is <span class="SimpleMath">-1</span>, otherwise its Frobenius number coincides with the maximum of the gaps (or fundamental gaps) of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span>. The Frobenius number plus one is known as the <em>conductor</em> of the semigroup. In this package we refer to the elements in the semigroup that are less than or equal to the conductor as <em>small elements</em> of the semigroup. Observe that from the definition, if <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is a numerical semigroup with Frobenius number <span class="SimpleMath">f</span>, then <span class="SimpleMath">f+ N∖{0}⊆ S</span>. An integer <span class="SimpleMath">z</span> is a <em>pseudo-Frobenius number</em> of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> if <span class="SimpleMath">z+S∖{0}⊆ S</span>. Thus the Frobenius number of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is one of its pseudo-Frobenius numbers. The <em>type</em> of a numerical semigroup is the cardinality of the set of its pseudo-Frobenius numbers.</p>

<p>The number of numerical semigroups having a given Frobenius number is finite. The elements in this set of numerical semigroups that are maximal with respect to set inclusion are precisely those numerical semigroups that cannot be expressed as intersection of two other numerical semigroups containing them properly, and thus they are known as <em>irreducible</em> numerical semigroups. Clearly, every numerical semigroup is the intersection of (finitely many) irreducible numerical semigroups.</p>

<p>A numerical semigroup <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> with Frobenius number <span class="SimpleMath">f</span> is <em>symmetric</em> if for every integer <span class="SimpleMath">x</span>, either <span class="SimpleMath">x∈ S</span> or <span class="SimpleMath">f-x∈ S</span>. The set of irreducible numerical semigroups with odd Frobenius number coincides with the set of symmetric numerical semigroups. The numerical semigroup <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is <em>pseudo-symmetric</em> if <span class="SimpleMath">f</span> is even and for every integer <span class="SimpleMath">x</span> not equal to <span class="SimpleMath">f/2</span> either <span class="SimpleMath">x∈ S</span> or <span class="SimpleMath">f-x∈ S</span>. The set of irreducible numerical semigroups with even Frobenius number is precisely the set of pseudo-symmetric numerical semigroups. These two classes of numerical semigroups have been widely studied in the literature due to their nice applications in Algebraic Geometry. This is probably one of the main reasons that made people turn their attention on numerical semigroups again in the last decades. Symmetric numerical semigroups can be also characterized as those with type one, and pseudo-symmetric numerical semigroups are those numerical semigroups with type two and such that its pseudo-Frobenius numbers are its Frobenius number and its Frobenius number divided by two.</p>

<p>Another class of numerical semigroups that catched the attention of researchers working on Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Ring Theory is the class of numerical semigroups with maximal embedding dimension. The <em>embedding dimension</em> of a numerical semigroup is the cardinality of its minimal system of generators. It can be shown that the embedding dimension is at most the multiplicity of the numerical semigroup. Thus <em>maximal embedding dimension</em> numerical semigroups are those numerical semigroups for which their embedding dimension and multiplicity coincide. These numerical semigroups have nice maximal properties, not only (of course) related to their embedding dimension, but also by means of their presentations. Among maximal embedding dimension there are two classes of numerical semigroups that have been studied due to the connections with the equivalence of algebroid branches. A numerical semigroup <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is Arf if for every <span class="SimpleMath">x≥ y≥ z∈ S</span>, then <span class="SimpleMath">x+y-z∈ S</span>; and it is <em>saturated</em> if the following condition holds: if <span class="SimpleMath">s,s_1,...,s_r∈ S</span> are such that <span class="SimpleMath">s_i≤ s</span> for all <span class="SimpleMath">i∈ {1,...,r}</span> and <span class="SimpleMath">z_1,...,z_r∈ Z</span> are such that <span class="SimpleMath">z_1s_1+⋯+z_rs_r≥ 0</span>, then <span class="SimpleMath">s+z_1s_1+⋯ +z_rs_r∈ S</span>.</p>

<p>If we look carefully inside the set of fundamental gaps of a numerical semigroup, we see that there are some fulfilling the condition that if they are added to the given numerical semigroup, then the resulting set is again a numerical semigroup. These elements are called <em>special gaps</em> of the numerical semigroup. A numerical semigroup other than the set of nonnegative integers is irreducible if and only if it has only a special gap.</p>

<p>The inverse operation to the one described in the above paragraph is that of removing an element of a numerical semigroup. If we want the resulting set to be a numerical semigroup, then the only thing we can remove is a minimal generator.</p>

<p>Let <span class="SimpleMath">a,b,c,d</span> be positive integers such that <span class="SimpleMath">a/b &lt; c/d</span>, and let <span class="SimpleMath">I=[a/b,c/d]</span>. Then the set <span class="SimpleMath">S(I)= N∩ ⋃_n≥ 0 n I</span> is a numerical semigroup. This class of numerical semigroups coincides with that of sets of solutions to equations of the form <span class="SimpleMath">A x mod B ≤ C x</span> with <span class="SimpleMath">A,B,C</span> positive integers. A numerical semigroup in this class is said to be <em>proportionally modular</em>.</p>

<p>A sequence of positive rational numbers <span class="SimpleMath">a_1/b_1 &lt; ⋯ &lt; a_n/b_n</span> with <span class="SimpleMath">a_i,b_i</span> positive integers is a <em>Bézout sequence</em> if <span class="SimpleMath">a_i+1b_i - a_i b_i+1=1</span> for all <span class="SimpleMath">i∈ {1,...,n-1}</span>. If <span class="SimpleMath">a/b=a_1/b_1 &lt; ⋯ &lt; a_n/b_n =c/d</span>, then <span class="SimpleMath">S([a/b,c/d])=⟨ a_1,...,a_n⟩</span>. Bézout sequences are not only interesting for this fact, they have shown to be a major tool in the study of proportionally modular numerical semigroups.</p>

<p>If <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is a numerical semigroup and <span class="SimpleMath">k</span> is a positive integer, then the set <span class="SimpleMath">S/k={ x∈ N | kx∈ S}</span> is a numerical semigroup, known as the <em>quotient</em> <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> by <span class="SimpleMath">k</span>.</p>

<p>Let <span class="SimpleMath">m</span> be a positive integer. A <em>subadditive</em> function with period <span class="SimpleMath">m</span> is a map <span class="SimpleMath">f: N-&gt; N</span> such that <span class="SimpleMath">f(0)=0</span>, <span class="SimpleMath">f(x+y)≤ f(x)+f(y)</span> and <span class="SimpleMath">f(x+m)=f(x)</span>. If <span class="SimpleMath">f</span> is a subadditive function with period <span class="SimpleMath">m</span>, then the set <span class="SimpleMath">M_f={ x∈ N | f(x)≤ x}</span> is a numerical semigroup. Moreover, every numerical semigroup is of this form. Thus a numerical semigroup can be given by a subadditive function with a given period. If <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is a numerical semigroup and <span class="SimpleMath">s∈ S, snot=0</span>, and <span class="SimpleMath">Ap(S,s)={ w(0),w(1),..., w(s-1)}</span>, then <span class="SimpleMath">f(x)=w(x mod s)</span> is a subadditive function with period <span class="SimpleMath">s</span> such that <span class="SimpleMath">M_f=S</span>.</p>

<p>Let <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> be a numerical semigroup generated by <span class="SimpleMath">{n_1,...,n_k}</span>. Then we can define the following morphism (called sometimes the factorization morphism) by <span class="SimpleMath">φ: N^k -&gt; S, φ(a_1,...,a_k)=a_1n_1+⋯+a_kn_k</span>. If <span class="SimpleMath">σ</span> is the kernel congruence of <span class="SimpleMath">φ</span> (that is, <span class="SimpleMath">aσ b</span> if <span class="SimpleMath">φ(a)=φ(b)</span>), then <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is isomorphic to <span class="SimpleMath">N^k/σ</span>. A <em>presentation</em> for <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> is a system of generators (as a congruence) of <span class="SimpleMath">σ</span>. If <span class="SimpleMath">{n_1,...,n_p}</span> is a minimal system of generators, then a <em>minimal presentation</em> is a presentation such that none of its proper subsets is a presentation. Minimal presentations of numerical semigroups coincide with presentations with minimal cardinality, though in general these two concepts are not the same for an arbitrary commutative semigroup.</p>

<p>A set <span class="SimpleMath">I</span> of integers is an <em>ideal relative to a numerical semigroup</em> <span class="SimpleMath">S</span> provided that <span class="SimpleMath">I+S⊆ I</span> and that there exists <span class="SimpleMath">d∈ S</span> such that <span class="SimpleMath">d+I⊆ S</span>. If <span class="SimpleMath">I⊆ S</span>, we simply say that <span class="SimpleMath">I</span> is an <em>ideal</em> of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span>. If <span class="SimpleMath">I</span> and <span class="SimpleMath">J</span> are relative ideals of <span class="SimpleMath">S</span>, then so is <span class="SimpleMath">I-J={z∈ Z | z+J⊆ I}</span>, and it is tightly related to the operation ":" of ideals in a commutative ring.</p>

<p>In this package we have implemented the functions needed to deal with the elements exposed in this introduction.</p>

<p>Many of the algorithms, and the necessary background to understand them, can be found in the monographs <a href="chapBib.html#biBfgcm">[RGS99c]</a>, <a href="chapBib.html#biBRGbook">[RGS09]</a> and <a href="chapBib.html#biBnsapp">[AGS16b]</a>. Some examples in these books have been illustrated with the help of this package. So the reader can also find there more examples on the usage of the functions implemented here.</p>
