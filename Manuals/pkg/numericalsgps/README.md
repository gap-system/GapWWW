NumericalSgps
=============

`NumericalSgps` is a GAP package for computing with Numerical Semigroups.


Introduction
------------

The features of the package `NumericalSgps` include

- defining numerical semigroups;
- computing several properties of numerical semigroups, namely: multiplicity, Frobenius number, (minimal) system of generators, Apéry set, gaps, fundamental gaps, etc.;
- perform several operations on numerical semigroups and ideals, namely: intersection, quotient by an integer, decompose into irreducible semigroups, add a special gap, ...;
-computing and testing membership to relevant families of numerical semigroups.

There is a manual in the sub-directory `doc` written using the GAP package
gapdoc which describes the available functions in detail. The pdf, html
versions of the manual are also available there.
