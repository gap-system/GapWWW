    README file for the `GradedModules' GAP4 package
        
To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download one of the
archive files
    GradedModules-x.x.tar.gz
    GradedModules-x.x.tar.bz2
    GradedModules-x.x.zip
and unpack it using 
    tar xvf GradedModules-x.x.tar.gz
respectively
    unzip GradedModules-x.x.zip
and so on.

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `GradedModules'.

This completes the installation of the package.

Testing the package is possible by invoking

ReadPackage( "GradedModules", "maketest.g" );

from within GAP.

E-mail us if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, we
would like to hear about applications of this package.
