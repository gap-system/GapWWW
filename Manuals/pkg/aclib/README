Aclib -- A Library of 3- and 4-Dimensional Almost Crystallographic Groups
=========================================================================

by Karel Dekimpe and Bettina Eick


Introduction
------------

The package `aclib' contains the almost crystallographic groups as 
classified by K. Dekimpe in the Springer Lecture Notes, Vol. 1639: 
"Almost Bieberbach Groups: Affine and Polynomial Structures". 

The groups are available as rational matrix groups. Further, all the
groups in the library are polycyclic. If the `Polycyclic' package for 
computations with infinite polycyclic groups is installed, then also
polycyclic presentations for the almost crystallographic groups are
available and can be used for computations with these groups.
