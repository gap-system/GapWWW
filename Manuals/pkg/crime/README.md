# CRIME

This GAP package computes cohomology rings for finite p-groups using Jon
Carlson's method, both as GAP objects, and also in terms of generators and
relators. It also computes induced homomorphisms on cohomology and Massey
products in the cohomology ring.

The latest version of this package is normally bundled with GAP, so it should
not be necessary to manually install it. However, if needed, you can always
download the latest version from <https://gap-packages.github.io/crime/>

Please refer to the package documentation for more information.
