### README - DeepThoughtPackage

## Introduction

This package provides functions for computations in finitely generated nilpotent groups given by a suitable presentation. These computations use polynomials which are computed using the Deep Thought algorithm. For more information see the documentation.

## Issues

For questions, remarks and issues please use the [issue tracker](
https://github.com/duskydolphin/DeepThoughtPackage/issues). 

## Tests

Test functions can be found in the /tst subdirectory. Note that some files have the ending .tstlong. Running them may take a while.
