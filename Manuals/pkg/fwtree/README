			Fwtree, a GAP-package
			---------------------

The  Fwtree  package  for  GAP  provides functions  to  reproduce  the
experimental results described in  our paper "Periodicities for graphs
of p-groups beyond coclass".

More precisely, it provides

    * functions to determine the rank, width and obliquity of a finite
      p-group, 

    * functions to investigate  the graph of all finite  p-groups of a
      given rank, width and obliquity, and

    * a library  of finite quotients of  certain infinite pro-p-groups
      of finite rank, width and obliquity.

			   Obtaining Fwtree
			   ----------------

Fwtree is available from its homepage

	    https://gap-packages.github.io/fwtree/


			  Installing Fwtree
			  -----------------

Download fwtree-1.0.tar.gz and extract  it into the `pkg' directory of
your GAP-installation. The package can  then be loaded from within GAP
using â€˜LoadPackage("fwtree").

			    Documentation
			    -------------

The documentation of fwtree is available in the `doc' directory and on
the homepage.
