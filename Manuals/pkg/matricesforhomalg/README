    README file for the `MatricesForHomalg' GAP4 package
        
To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download one of the
archive files
    MatricesForHomalg-x.x.tar.gz
    MatricesForHomalg-x.x.tar.bz2
    MatricesForHomalg-x.x.zip
and unpack it using 
    tar xvf MatricesForHomalg-x.x.tar.gz
respectively
    unzip MatricesForHomalg-x.x.zip

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `MatricesForHomalg'.

This completes the installation of the package.

Testing the package is possible by invoking

ReadPackage( "MatricesForHomalg", "maketest.g" );

from within GAP.

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I
would like to hear about applications of this package.
