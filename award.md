The GAP Council would like to reward significant contributions to the
GAP system once per year, by giving "GAP Excellence Awards" to
outstanding young contributors, recognising that their work demonstrates
the highest standards of professionalism.

Each year, we will issue a call for nominations on this website and the
[GAP Forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/forum/), usually with a deadline in
mid-August.

Once the call is open, if you are aware of any young GAP contributors,
please nominate them with an email to the mailing list
<prize@gap-system.org>.

Please provide the nominees’ details (including home institution and
email address) along with information on their GAP contributions
(including a brief description and a link to the code).

Self-nominations are possible. It would be helpful to include the name
of a potential supporter for the nomination.

All contributors to the GAP system are eligible, including contributors
to the main system as well as to GAP packages. Nominees should be
'young' in the sense that they are currently students, PhD candidates or
postdocs, and do not yet hold a permanent position.

A committee of GAP Council members will review the nominations and
select the award winners. Each award winner will receive a certificate
acknowledging their significant contributions to GAP, and will be listed
on this website.
