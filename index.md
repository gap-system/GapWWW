### What is GAP?

GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular
emphasis on Computational Group Theory.
GAP provides a {% include ref.html label="The Programming Language"
text="programming language" %}, a library of thousands of functions
implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP language as well as
large data libraries of
algebraic objects. See
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/About/overview.html) for details of the mathematical capabilities.
The system, including source, is distributed
[freely]({{ site.baseurl }}/copyright/).
You can study and easily modify or extend it for your special use.


### How to obtain GAP?

How to install GAP is described in [Installation]({{ site.baseurl }}/Install/).
The current release is GAP {{site.data.release.version}} and it can be
obtained from our [release page](Install/release.html).
This website describes this release if not stated otherwise. 
Changes from earlier versions are described in the
[Release history](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/master/CHANGES.md).


### We are looking forward to hearing from you!

We welcome contributions to GAP. The GAP development repository is
hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/gap-system/gap). You may find some
guidance on contributing via GitHub
[here](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
If you have any questions, or suggestions for GAP, the repository, or
documentation, feel free to contact us via the [open GAP development
mailing list](https://lists.uni-kl.de/gap/info/gap) or
submit an issue or a pull request on GitHub.
There is an [extensive documentation](Doc/doc.html) advising how to
write a GAP code. Also there is a
[guidance](https://gap-packages.github.io/example/) on
developing a [GAP package](packages) and its
[submission](Packages/Authors/submit.html) to GAP.


### Acknowledgements

GAP has been and is developed by international cooperation of many people,
including user contributions. We gratefully acknowledge all this help as
well as some
[funding]({{ site.baseurl }}/About#funding). GAP was
started at [Lehrstuhl D für
Mathematik](https://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/LDFM/), RWTH Aachen in
[1986]({{ site.baseurl }}/About/History/preface_2.4.html).
After 1997
the development of GAP was coordinated in [St
Andrews](https://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/). Since March 2005, the
[GAP Centers]({{ site.baseurl }}/centres/) in
[Aachen](https://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/LDFM/),
[Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/iaa/),
Fort Collins,
and [St Andrews](https://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/) took over coordination.
They were joined by [Kaiserslautern](https://math.rptu.de/ags/agag/)
as fifth GAP center in 2020.
Since July 2022, the GAP center in Kaiserslautern is coordinating the
further development and maintenance of GAP.

In July 2008, GAP was awarded the *ACM/SIGSAM Richard Dimick [Jenks
Memorial Prize](https://www.sigsam.org/awards/jenks/index.html) for
Excellence in Software Engineering applied to Computer Algebra*.
