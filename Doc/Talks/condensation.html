  Condensation techniques are being used as one of the workhorses of
  computational representation theory, for both the analysis of given
  matrix or permutation representations and the explicit construction of
  matrix representations.
</p>
<p>
  Formally, these techniques are explicit computational applications of
  suitable Schur functors, see e. g. [Green]: Let A be a finite-dimensional
  algebra over a field F, and let e be an idempotent in A. Then the
  corresponding Schur functor maps an A-module V to the eAe-module Ve,
  where the subset Ve of V is the image of the projection induced by e.
</p>
<p>
  In the group algebra case A=FG, where G is a finite group, this is
  applied as follows: Let H be a subgroup of G such that the
  characteristic of F does not divide the order of H. Then
  <br /></p>
<p class="center">
  e = &#124;H&#124;<sup>&#8722;1</sup> &#8721;<sub>h  &#8712; H</sub> h
</p>
<p>
  is an idempotent in FG. The subset Ve of an FG-module V is the set of
  H-fixed points in V, hence this technique is called fixed point condensation.
</p>
<p>
  Algorithms for fixed point condensation have been developed,
  implemented and used by various people, see e. g. [Müller] for a more
  detailed overview. In particular, the following applications
  underline the role of GAP as a valuable research tool:
</p>
<p>
  Finding so-called faithful idempotents has been pursued in [Lux],
  where in particular the
  <a href="/Packages/ctbllib.html">character&nbsp;tables</a> and
  <a href="/Datalib/tom.html">tables&nbsp;of&nbsp;marks</a> libraries
  of GAP have been used. Fixed point condensation of induced
  modules has been described and implemented as GAP-code in
  [Müller-Rosenboom].
</p>
<p>
  So-called direct condensation of permutation modules is based on the
  general computational task of enumerating large G-sets. Programs using
  the technique of distributed computing have been described in
  [Lübeck-Neunhöffer], where the overall implementation is as C-code,
  but certain precomputation programs are written as GAP-code.
  An application of direct condensation techniques is given in
  [Müller-Neunhöffer-Röhr-Wilson], where again both C-programs and
  GAP-programs are used. Enumeration of huge G-sets, together
  with applications, has been described in [Müller], where the latter
  programs are written completely as GAP-code.
</p>
<p>
  Typically, the GAP-parts of the above-mentioned
  implementations make use of the basic data structures and arithmetical
  features of GAP, such as permutations or
  {% include ref.html manual="Reference: Row Vectors over Finite Fields" text="vectors" %}
  and {% include ref.html manual="Reference: Matrices over Finite Fields" text="matrices" %}
  over small finite fields, and the possibility to handle them efficiently
  and manipulate them easily. These specially tailored programs are not part
  of the official GAP-distribution, and for more details the
  reader is referred to the various authors.
