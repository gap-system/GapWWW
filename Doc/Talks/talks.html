<p>
  This is a rather mixed collection of preprints, overhead projector slides,
  and handouts from talks on topics from computational group theory, most
  of them by members of the GAP Group and most 
  of them wholly or partly about GAP. They are sorted in
  reverse chronological order (newest first). The
  last of them even predates GAP and some of those from 1997
  reflect the changeover from GAP&nbsp;3 to GAP&nbsp;4,
  so they are mainly of historical interest. Some of the examples described
  in the documents refer to earlier versions of GAP.
  Updated versions of such have been inserted into the collection of
  <a href="/Doc/Examples/examples.html">Examples</a>. Also, there are
  pointers from the page
  <a href="/Doc/Learning/learning.html">Learning&nbsp;GAP</a>
  to those talks which were intended to introduce to GAP or
  special ascpects of it. See also the page 
  <a href="/Doc/applications.html">Applications</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In the way of conference talks, many of them were prepared in a hurry,
  and/or without references to hand. Details should not be relied upon
  without checking, and certainly represent no more than the opinion of
  the author at the time. There is also some overlap between them.
</p>
<p>
  In several cases, OHP slides were prepared using <code>LaTeX</code> and
  the <code>lslide</code> style, which can be obtained from our 
  <a href="{{site.data.gap.gap3dist}}util/lslide.zoo">web&nbsp;server</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  Additional contributions are welcome. We may also announce some externally
  available GAP related materials on <a href="https://twitter.com/gap_system">Twitter</a>.

Talks from <a href="http://gapdays.de/"><b>GAP Days</b></a><br/>
Since 2014, we periodically organise GAP Days. These are meetings where
developers and users with programming experience are invited to influence
the future development of GAP by initiating and contributing to discussions
and coding sprints. You can find materials from past GAP days
(and information about the future ones) under respective
pages <a href="http://gapdays.de/"><b>here</b></a>.
