Notable extensions from version 3.1 to version 3.2, which were announced as
our plans in the preface of version 3.1 are the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  the removal of the restriction of the degree of permutations,
</li>
<li>
  extensions of the methods for for permutation groups, e.g.,
  for finding the composition factors,
</li>
<li>
  extension of the methods for finite presentations, e.g., by
  reduced Reidemeister-Schreier, Modified Todd-Coxeter, and
  Tietze methods,
</li>
<li>
  further tools for getting character tables, e.g., by the
  Dixon-Schneider method working from class multiplication
  coefficients, and for working with character tables, e.g, for
  finding permutation characters. Other extensions include a
  package for univariate polynomials over a coefficient ring.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Version 3.2 is the first to provide separate packages in the form of a
GAP <b>share library</b> (see chapter 47 for details).
At present there are
three such packages, the ANU p-quotient and p-group generation package by
Eamonn O'Brien and Mike Newman, the (nonperiodic) Nilpotent Quotient
program of Werner Nickel, and a package for Weyl groups by Meinolf Geck.
</p><p>
Of course the development of GAP will go on. Of our own
plans for this
that were already mentioned in the introduction to version 3.1 there
remain the removal of the present restriction of the size of finite
fields and better means of working with the output of the subgroup
lattice program. Further plans for the near future include still further
additions to the methods for permutation groups, the start of a package
of tools for matrix groups, the provision of graphical output through an
X-window interface and a debugger. Again some of these plans are already
in some state of implementation, but just did not make it for the
deadline that we had set for this release.

</p><p>
The reliability of large systems of computer programs is a well known
general problem and, although over the past year the record of
GAP in this respect has not been too bad, of course
GAP is not exempt from
this problem. We therefore feel that it is mandatory that we, but also
other users, are warned of bugs that have been encountered in
GAP or when doubts have arisen. We ask all users of
GAP to use the GAP forum for issuing such
warnings.
