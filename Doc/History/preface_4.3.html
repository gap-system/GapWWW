<p>
Welcome to GAP. This preface serves not only to introduce this
manual, "the GAP Tutorial", but also as an introduction to the
system as a whole, and in particular to version 4 release 3
(or GAP&nbsp;4.3 for short).
</p><p>
GAP stands for <b>Groups, Algorithms and Programming</b>.
The name was
chosen to reflect the aim of the system, which is introduced in this
tutorial manual. Since that choice, the system has become somewhat
broader, and you will also find information about algorithms and
programming for other algebraic structures, such as semigroups and
algebras.
</p><p>
There are four further manuals in addition to this one: the "Reference
Manual" containing detailed documentation of the mathematical functionality
of GAP; "Extending GAP" containing some tutorial
material on various aspects of GAP programming; "Programming
in GAP&nbsp;4" containing detailed documentation of various
aspects of the system of interest mainly to programmers; and "New Features
for Developers" containing details of some newly introduced features
which we may wish to change in a future release and so do not want to
include in the main reference manual. Some of the functionality
of the system and a number of contributed extensions are provided as
"GAP packages" and each of these has its own manual. This
preface, however, serves as an introduction to the whole system.
</p><p>
Subsequent sections of this preface explain the structure of the
system and the arrangements for the attribution of credit for
authorship and maintenance of the system; acknowledge those who have
made particular contributions to this and previous releases and
outline the changes from earlier versions.
</p>

<h3>
  The GAP System
</h3>
<p>
GAP is a <b>free</b>, <b>open</b> and <b>extensible</b>
software package for
computation in discrete abstract algebra. The terms "free" and
"open" describe the conditions under which the system is distributed -- in
brief, it is <b>free of charge</b> (except possibly for the immediate costs
of delivering it to you), you are <b>free to pass it on</b> within certain
limits, and all of the workings of the system are <b>open for you to
examine and change</b>. Details of these conditions can be found
in the Copyright Notice of the previous page.
</p><p>
The system is "extensible" in that you can write your own programs in
the GAP language, and use them in just the same way as the
programs which form part of the system (the "library"). Indeed, we actively
support the contribution, refereeing and distribution of extensions to
the system, in the form of "GAP packages". Further details of
this can be found in chapter "GAP Packages" in the
Reference Manual, and on our World Wide Web site.
</p><p>
Development of GAP began at Lehrstuhl D für Mathematik,
RWTH-Aachen, under the leadership of Prof.&nbsp;Joachim Neubüser
in 1985. Version 2.4 was released in 1988 and version 3.1 in 1992.
The final full release of GAP&nbsp;3, version 3.4, was made
in 1994. In 1997, Prof.&nbsp;Neubüser retired, and overall coordination of
GAP development, now very much an international effort, was
transferred to St Andrews. A complete internal redesign and almost
complete rewrite of the system, which was already in progress in
Aachen, was completed and following five, increasingly usable,
beta-test releases, version 4.1, released July 1999, was the first
version of the rewritten system to be released without any restriction
for general use. Version 4.2 followed in spring 2000 and, this
version, GAP&nbsp;4.3 is being released in May 2002.
</p><p>
More information on the motivation and development of GAP
to date, can be found on our Web pages in a section entitled "Release
history and Prefaces".
</p><p>
For those readers who have used an earlier version of GAP,
an overview of the changes from GAP&nbsp;4.2, and a brief
summary of changes from GAP&nbsp;3 is given in section
"Changes from Earlier Versions" below.
</p><p>
The system that you are getting now consists of a "core system" and
a number of packages. The core system consists of four main parts.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
  A <b>kernel</b>, written in C, which provides the user with
  <br /><br />
  <ul>
  <li>
    automatic dynamic storage management, which the user needn't bother
    about in his programming;
  </li><li>
    a set of time-critical basic functions, e.g. "arithmetic",
    operations for integers, finite fields, permutations and words, as
    well as natural operations for lists and records;
  </li><li>
    an interpreter for the GAP language, an untyped
    imperative programming language with functions as first class objects
    and some extra built-in data types such as permutations and finite
    field elements. The language supports a form of object-oriented
    programming, similar to that supported by languages like C++ and
    Java but with some important differences.
  </li><li>
    a small set of system functions allowing the GAP
    programmer to handle files and execute external programs in a uniform
    way, regardless of the particular operating system in use.
  </li><li>
    a set of programming tools for testing, debugging, and timing
    algorithms.
  </li><li>
    a "read-eval-view" style user interface.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  A much larger <b>library of GAP functions</b> that
  implement algebraic and other algorithms. Since this is written
  entirely in the GAP language, the GAP
  language is both the
  main implementation language and the user language of the system.
  Therefore the user can as easily as the original programmers
  investigate and vary algorithms of the library and add new ones to
  it, first for own use and eventually for the benefit of all
  GAP users.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  A <b>library of group theoretical data</b> which contains
  various libraries of groups, including the library of small groups
  (containing all groups of order at most 2000, except those of order
  1024) and others. Large libraries of ordinary and Brauer character
  tables and Tables of Marks are included as packages.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  The <b>documentation</b>. This is available as on-line help, as
  printable files in various formats and as HTML for viewing
  with a Web browser.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Also included with the core system are some test files and a few
small utilities which we hope you will find useful.
</p><p>
<b>GAP packages</b> are self-contained extensions to the
core system. A package contains GAP code and its own
documentation and may also contain data files or external programs to
which the GAP code provides an interface. These packages
may be loaded into GAP using
the 'RequirePackage' command, and both the package and its
documentation are then available just as if they were parts of the
core system. Some packages may be loaded automatically, when
GAP is
started, if they are present. Some packages, because they depend on
external programs, may only be available on the operating systems
where those programs are available (usually UNIX). You should note
that, while the packages included with this release are the most
recent versions ready for release at this time, new packages and new
versions may be released at any time and can be easily installed in
your copy of GAP.
</p><p>
With GAP&nbsp;4.3, there are two packages (the library of
ordinary and Brauer character tables, and the library of tables of marks)
which contain functionality developed from parts of the
GAP&nbsp;4.2
core system. These have been moved into packages for ease of maintenance
and to allow new versions to be released independently of new releases
of the core system. The library of small groups should also be
regarded as a package, although it does not currently use the standard
'RequirePackage' mechanism. Other packages (included in separate
archives for download) contain functionality which has never been part
of the core system.
</p>

<h3>
  Authorship and Maintenance
</h3>
<p>
Previous versions of GAP have simply included the
increasingly long list of all of the authors of the system with no
indication as to who contributed what. In GAP&nbsp;4.3
we have introduced a new concept:
<b>modules</b>, to allow us to report the authorship of the system in more
detail. A module is a part of GAP which provides identifiable
functionality and has reasonably clean interfaces with the rest of the
system (usually it consists of separate files). Each module has its
own lists of authors and maintainers, which are not necessarily the
same. A preliminary list of modules and their attributions appears in
this manual. Note that we are still in the process of identifying
modules within the system, so large parts of the system do not yet
fall into any module. Since also we all collaborate closely in
designing, developing and debugging the system, it should not be
assumed that the list of modules in this manual represents all of
everyone's contribution, or that it lists everyone who made any
contribution at all to each module.
</p><p>
All GAP packages are also considered to be modules and have
their own authors and maintainers. It should however be noted that some
packages provide interfaces between GAP and an external
program, a
copy of which is included for convenience, and that, in these cases,
we do not claim that the module authors or maintainers wrote, or
maintain, this external program. Similarly, some modules and packages
include large data libraries that may have been computed by many
people. We try to make clear in each case what credit is attributable
to whom.
</p><p>
We have, for some time, operated a refereeing system for contributed
packages, both to ensure the quality of the software we distribute,
and to provide recognition for the authors. We now consider this to be
a refereeing system for modules, and we would note, in particular
that, although it does not use the standard package interface, the
library of small groups has been refereed and accepted on exactly the
same basis as the accepted packages.
</p><p>
We also include with this distribution, in a separate archive, a
number of packages which have not (yet) gone through our refereeing
process. Some may be accepted in the future, in other cases the
authors have chosen not to submit them. More information can be found
on our World Wide Web site, see section "Further Information about
GAP".
</p>

<h3>
  Acknowledgements
</h3>
<p>
Very many people have worked on, and contributed to, GAP
over the years since its inception. On our Web site you will find the
prefaces to the previous releases, each of which acknowledges people who
have made special contributions to that release. Even so, it is appropriate
to mention here Joachim Neubüser whose vision of a free, open and
extensible system for computational algebra inspired GAP
in the first place, and Martin Schönert, who was the technical architect
of GAP&nbsp;3 and GAP&nbsp;4.
</p><p>
In the two years since the release of version 4.2, GAP
development has become a more and more widely distributed operation, and
increasingly dependent on hard voluntary work by developers not solely
or mainly employed to work on GAP, nevertheless, the
development process has remained constructive and friendly, even when
wrangling over difficult technical decisions, or sensitive questions of
attribution and credit and I must express my huge gratitude to
everyone involved for this.
</p><p>
The list of modules which appears in this manual now gives a partial
idea of the contributions of different people, but I should like to
mention some people who have made important contributions to the
development process over the last two years that do not show up there:
Alexander Hulpke has remained a tower of strength, with unparalleled
oversight of many parts of the library, despite now having a teaching
post; Thomas Breuer continues to develop many areas of the system, and
to play a vital role in clarifying our underlying concepts, despite
now working in industry; Frank Lübeck and Max
Neunhöffer have brought much fresh insight to bear on the
design of crucial parts of the system, and also done a lot of the
ensuing work; Greg Gamble and Volkmar Felsch have both brought
enormous persistence to correcting very many details of the
documentation, improving error messages and generally polishing the
system; and very many others have contributed ideas, insight and hard
work to produce this release. Senior colleagues, especially Joachim
Neubüser, Edmund Robertson, and Charlie Wright, continue to
provide encouragement support and constructive criticism.
</p>

<h3>
  Changes from Earlier Versions
</h3>
<p>
The main changes between GAP&nbsp;4.2 and
GAP&nbsp;4.3 are:
</p><p>
<b>Potentially Incompatible Changes</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  There have been many adjustments to the arithmetic of lists (including
  matrices and vectors). These include performance enhancements in many
  areas, and also extended, and more precisely documented, rules for the
  results of arithmetic operations applied to lists, including rules for
  the mutability of the results. The main visible consequences of this
  are that a lot of operations that previously gave errors now give
  results, but, in a few unusual cases, the mutability status, or even
  the value, of the results may be different. More specifically:
  <br /><br />
  <ul>
  <li>
    The scope of the arithmetic operations is extended to some objects for
    which it is currently undefined, or unimplemented.
  </li><li>
    The mutability of the results of unary arithmetic operations such
    as unary -, multiplication by zero, and raising to the power 0 or
    -1, applied to immutable lists has changed. See section
    "Arithmetic for Lists" for details.
  </li><li>
    The behaviour under multiplication of lists of nesting depth three or
    more is changed.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  Finitely-presented monoids have been added to the system as
  objects in their own right. Dividing a free monoid by a list of
  relations now produced a finitely-presented monoid, whereas previously
  it produced a finitely-presented semigroup.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  A number of documented functions which have been renamed, or whose
  functionality is now unnecessary or better achieved in other ways have
  been declared "obsolescent" and will be removed in
  GAP&nbsp;4.4. These functions have been moved to the file
  'obsolete.g' in the GAP library. Perhaps the best known
  of these functions are the permutation group functions with the old
  'Operation' names (such as 'OperationHomomorphism'. These all have
  replacements like 'ActionHomomorphism' with 'Action' names.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These changes are, in some respects, departures from our policy of
maintaining upwards compatibility of documented functions between
releases. In the first case, we felt that the old behaviour was
sufficiently inconsistent, illogical, and impossible to document that
we had no alternative but to change it. In the second case the change
was necessary to introduce new functionality. The planned and phased
removal of a few unnecessary functions or symonyms is needed to avoid
becoming buried in "legacy" interfaces, but we remain committed to
our policy of maintaining upwards compatibility whenever sensibly possible.
</p><p>
<b>Changes to Mathematical Functionality</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  The performance of several routines has been substantially improved (e.g.
  File I/O, large degree permutation groups, finite field matrices, matrix
  groups, double cosets, permutation group homomorphisms, Solvable quotient,
  Knuth-Bendix)
</li><li>
  Many bugs have been fixed. This release thus incorporates the contents
  of all the bugfixes which were released for GAP&nbsp;4.2.
  It also fixes a number of bugs discovered since the last bugfix.
</li><li>
  The functionality for finitely presented groups has been improved,
  including the addition of effective support for homomorphisms for finitely
  presented groups.
</li><li>
  Routines for the calculation of the Schur multiplier and a
  Schur Cover of finite permutation groups are now available.
</li><li>
  An implementation of Dixon's method for computing ordinary representations
  of groups has been added.
</li><li>
  The methods for decomposing a group element as a word in given generators
  and for computing a presentation of a given group have been substantially
  enhanced.
</li><li>
  More general methods to form group products are available.
</li><li>
  Generators for orthogonal groups of odd dimension in characteristic 2 have
  been added.
</li><li>
  Methods for 'NrConjugacyClasses' have been added for many classical groups.
</li><li>
  Errors in the (theoretical) classification of irreducible solvable matrix
  groups have been resolved.
</li><li>
  A special representation for univariate rational functions was added.
</li><li>
  Straight line program elements have been added.
</li><li>
  The built-in MeatAxe now can treat the so-called "bad case" well.
</li><li>
  The list of Conway polynomials for finite fields has been extended.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Changes to the Data Libraries</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  The library of transitive permutation groups has been extended from degree
  23 to degree 31.
</li><li>
  The library of irreducible maximal finite integral matrix groups has
  been extended from degree 24 to degree 31.
</li><li>
  The library of character tables and the library of tables of marks
  have been moved into packages for easier maintenance and upgrade. Some
  new tables have been added.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Changes to the System</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Limitations on the length of integers and strings that can be read
  into GAP have been removed, integers can also be read in in
  hexadecimal format.
</li><li>
  The ability to read and write binary strings has been added.
</li><li>
  A filename starting with a tilde now refers by default to the home
  directory.
</li><li>
  The online help interface has been greatly improved. Further help viewers
  have been added (in particular viewers for 'dvi' and 'pdf' files).
</li><li>
  The Windows installation has been simplified for the case where you
  are installing GAP in its standard location.
</li><li>
  Utilities for editing GAP files with 'vim' or 'emacs' are
  provided.
</li><li>
  The '-K' option can be used to limit the amount of workspace used.
</li><li>
  New interfaces allow more control of the user interface, for instance
  colouring the 'gap>' prompt, or modifying break loop behaviour.
</li><li>
  A 'continue' statement has been added to the GAP language,
  analagous to that in C
</li><li>
  Numerous unreliable or potentially confusing C constructions reported
  by various C compilers have been removed. The system now compiles with
  few or no warnings on all the compilers we could test.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The most important changes between GAP&nbsp;4.1 and
GAP&nbsp;4.2 were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  A much extended and improved library of small groups as well as
  associated IdGroup routines.
</li><li>
  The primitive groups library has been made more independent of the
  rest of GAP, some errors were corrected.
</li><li>
  New (and often much faster) infrastructure for orbit computation, based
  on a general "dictionary" abstraction.
</li><li>
  New functionality for dealing with representations of algebras, and
  in particular for semisimple Lie algebras.
</li><li>
  New functionality for binary relations on arbitrary sets, magmas and
  semigroups.
</li><li>
  Bidirectional streams, allowing an external process to be started and then
  controlled "interactively" by GAP
</li><li>
  A prototype implementation of algorithms using general subgroup chains.
</li><li>
  Changes in the behaviour of vectors over small finite fields.
</li><li>
  A fifth book "New features for Developers" has been added to the
  GAP manual.
</li><li>
  Numerous bug fixes and performance improvements
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The changes between the final release of GAP&nbsp;3
(version 3.4.4) and GAP&nbsp;4 are wide-ranging. The general
philosophy of the changes is two-fold. Firstly, many assumptions in the
design of GAP&nbsp;3 revealed its authors' primary interest
in group theory, and indeed in finite group theory. Although much of the
GAP&nbsp;4 library is concerned with groups, the basic
design now allows extension to
other algebraic structures, as witnessed by the inclusion of
substantial bodies of algorithms for computation with semigroups and
Lie algebras. Secondly, as the scale of the system, and the number of
people using and contributing to it has grown, some aspects of the
underlying system have proved to be restricting, and these have been
improved as part of comprehensive re-engineering of the system. This
has included the new method selection system, which underpins the
library, and a new, much more flexible, GAP package
interface.
</p><p>
Details of these changes can be found in chapter "Migrating to
GAP&nbsp;4" of this manual. It is perhaps worth mentioning
a few points here.
</p><p>
Firstly, much remains unchanged, from the perspective of the mathematical
user:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  The syntax of that part of the GAP language that most
  users need for investigating mathematical problems.
</li><li>
  The great majority of function names.
</li><li>
  Data libraries and the access to them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A number of visible aspects have changed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Some function names that need finer specifications now that there are
  more structures available in GAP.
</li><li>
  The access to information already obtained about a mathematical
  structure. In GAP&nbsp;3 such information about a group
  could be looked up by directly inspecting the group record, whereas in
  GAP&nbsp;4 functions must be used to access such information.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Behind the scenes, much has changed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  A new kernel, with improvements in memory management and in
  the language interpreter, as well as new features such as saving of
  workspaces and the possibility of compilation of GAP
  code into C.
</li><li>
  A new structure to the library, based upon a new type and
  method selection system, which is able to support a broader range of
  algebraic computation and to make the structure of the library simpler
  and more modular.
</li><li>
  New and faster algorithms in many mathematical areas.
</li><li>
  Data structures and algorithms for new mathematical objects, such as
  algebras and semigroups.
</li><li>
  A new and more flexible structure for the GAP installation
  and documentation, which means, for example, that a GAP
  package and its documentation can be installed and be fully usable
  without any changes to the GAP system.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A very few features of GAP&nbsp;3 are not yet available in
GAP&nbsp;4.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Not all of the GAP&nbsp;3 packages have yet been converted
  for use with GAP&nbsp;4 (although several new packages are
  available only in GAP&nbsp;4).
</li><li>
  The Galois group determination algorithms which were implemented in the
  GAP&nbsp;3 library are not present in
  GAP&nbsp;4.
</li><li>
  The algorithms for the factorization of polynomials over algebraic number
  fields which were implemented in the GAP&nbsp;3 library
  are not present in GAP&nbsp;4.
</li><li>
  The library of crystallographic groups which was present in
  GAP&nbsp;3 is now part of a GAP&nbsp;4
  package 'crystcat'.
</li>
</ul>

</li><li>
  The GAP Forum -- an email discussion forum for comments,
  discussions or questions about GAP. You must subscribe to
  the list before you can post to it, see the Web page for details.
</li><li>
  The email address gap-trouble@dcs.st-and.ac.uk to which you
  are asked to send any questions or bug reports which do not seem likely
  to be of interest to the whole GAP Forum. Section
  "If Things Go Wrong" in the Reference Manual tells you what to include
  in a bug report.
</li><li>
  The email address gap@dcs.st-and.ac.uk to which we ask you
  send a brief message when you install GAP.
</li><li>
  The correct form of citation of GAP, which we ask you use
  whenever you publish scientific results obtained using GAP.

<p>
It finally remains for me to wish you all pleasure and success in using
GAP, and to invite your constructive comment and criticism.
