<p>
GAP stands for <b>Groups, Algorithms and Programming</b>.
The name was
chosen to reflect the aim of the system, which is introduced in this
tutorial manual. Since that choice, the system has become somewhat
broader, and you will also find information about algorithms and
programming for other algebraic structures, such as semigroups and
algebras.
</p><p>
There are three further manuals in addition to this one: the "Reference
Manual" containing detailed documentation of the mathematical
functionality of GAP; "Extending GAP"
containing some tutorial material on various aspects of GAP
programming; and "Programming in GAP&nbsp;4" containing
detailed documentation of various aspects of the system of interest mainly
to programmers.
</p><p>
GAP is a <b>free</b>, <b>open</b> and <b>extensible</b>
software package for
computation in discrete abstract algebra. The terms "free" and
"open" describe the conditions under which the system is distributed -- in
brief, it is <b>free of charge</b> (except possibly for the immediate costs
of delivering it to you), you are <b>free to pass it on</b> within certain
limits, and all of the workings of the system are <b>open for you to
examine and change</b>. Details of these conditions can be found in the
reference manual in chapter "Copyright Notice". The system is "extensible"
in that you can write your own programs in the GAP
language, and use them in just the same way as the programs which form
part of the system (the "library"). Indeed, we actively support the
contribution, refereeing and distribution of extensions to the system, in
the form of "share packages". Further details of this can be found in
chapter "Share Packages" in the reference manual, and on our World
Wide Web site.
</p><p>
Development of GAP began at Lehrstuhl D f端r Mathematik,
RWTH-Aachen,
under the leadership of Prof.&nbsp;Joachim Neub端ser in 1985. Version 2.4 was
released in 1988 and version 3.1 in 1992. The final full release of
GAP&nbsp;3, version 3.4, was made in 1994. A more detailed
account of the motivation and development of these versions of
GAP is contained in section "From the Preface for
GAP&nbsp;3.4, June 1994", below.
</p><p>
Since then, there have been two dramatic transitions in the GAP
project. Firstly, in 1997, Prof.&nbsp;Neub端ser retired, and overall
coordination of GAP development, now very much an international
effort, was transferred to St Andrews. Secondly a complete internal
redesign and almost complete rewrite of the system, which was already in
progress in Aachen, has been completed. Following five, increasingly
usable, beta-test releases, version 4.1 is the first version of the
rewritten system to be released without qualification for general use.
</p><p>
For those readers who have used an earlier version of GAP,
an overview of the changes from the beta-test releases and from
GAP&nbsp;3 is given in section "Changes from Earlier Versions"
below.
</p><p>
The system that you are getting now consists of four parts.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
  A <b>kernel</b>, written in C, which provides the user with
  <ul>
  <li>
    automatic dynamic storage management, which the user needn't bother
    about in his programming;
  </li><li>
    a set of time-critical basic functions, e.g. "arithmetic", operations
    for integers, finite field elements, permutations and words, as
    well as natural operations for lists and records;
  </li><li>
    an interpreter for the GAP language, an untyped
    imperative programming language with functions as first class objects
    and some extra built-in data types such as permutations and finite
    field elements.
  </li><li>
    support for the time critical parts of the new GAP4 method
    selection system.
  </li><li>
    a small set of system functions allowing the GAP
    programmer to handle files and execute external programs in a uniform
    way, regardless of the particular operating system in use.
  </li><li>
    a set of programming tools for testing, debugging, and timing
    algorithms.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  A much larger <b>library of GAP functions</b> that
  implement algebraic and other algorithms. Since this is written entirely
  in the GAP language, the GAP language is
  both the main
  implementation language and the user language of the system.
  Therefore the user can as easily as the original programmers
  investigate and vary algorithms of the library and add new ones to
  it, first for own use and eventually for the benefit of all
  GAP users.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  A <b>library of group theoretical data</b> which already contains
  various libraries of groups, large libraries of ordinary and
  Brauer character tables, including all of the Cambridge <b>Atlas of
  Finite Groups</b> and <b>Atlas of Brauer Characters</b>, a <b>library of
  tables of marks</b>, a <b>library of small groups</b> (containing all
  groups of order at most 1000, except those of order 512) and others.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  The <b>documentation</b>. This is available as files that can either be
  used for on-line help or processed for printing with \TeX\ or into
  HTML for viewing with a browser such as 'netscape'.
</li></ol>
<p>
Together with the system we distribute <b>GAP share
packages</b>, which are
separate packages which have been written by various groups of people and
remain under their responsibility. Some of these packages are written
completely in the GAP language, others totally or in part
in C (or even other languages). However the functions in these packages
can be called directly from GAP and results are returned
to GAP.
</p><p>
We operate a refereeing system for such packages, both to ensure the
quality of the software we distribute, and to provide recognition for the
authors. A number of GAP&nbsp;4 share packages have already
been accepted. Some others that have been submitted for review are available
as "preprints". More information can be found on our World Wide Web
site, see section "Further Information about GAP".

</p><p>
Before going on to mention more recent contributions, I must express my
heartfelt thanks, and I am sure, that of the wider community of
GAP developers and users for the immense work that Joachim
Neub端ser himself has put into GAP over many years.
The system would never have
existed, let alone grown and prospered as it has, without his clear
vision of what he wanted it to become, his ceaseless vigilance for
opportunities for development, his championing of the cause of
computation in group theory, his high standards which would not admit
"merely adequate" solutions and his constant encouragement of everyone
working on and with the system. We are all the richer for his efforts.
</p><p>
Many people have contributed to GAP development over the
last two
years. Alexander Hulpke has been a tower of strength, coordinating the
work on the library, finding subtle bugs in code whose authors were no
longer contactable, supporting the beta testers and, most recently
coordinating the process of stabilization and debugging leading up to
this release. Thomas Breuer in Aachen has remained our "conscience",
pointing out to us when we were misusing GAP&nbsp;4 concepts
and so storing up trouble for later. He has also done an enormous amount
of work on the support for representation theory in GAP.
Others I would like to
point out here include Bettina Eick, Volkmar Felsch, Willem de Graaf,
Werner Nickel and Andrew Solomon. I should like to thank all of these
people, and all the other contributors whom I have not mentioned
explicitly for their efforts, their cheerfulness and their perseverance.
I should also like to thank all the GAP4 beta-testers, package
developers, manual proof readers and others who have given us extremely
valuable and positive feedback.
</p><p>
GAP development in St Andrews has been financially
supported by the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Leverhulme Trust,
the European Commission (ESPRIT programme), the Royal Society of
Edinburgh and the British Council, to all of whom we are very grateful.
Development also takes place at other centres with support from other
funding bodies.
</p><p>
It finally remains for me to wish you all pleasure and success in using
GAP, and to invite your constructive comment and criticism.

<h3>
  Changes from Earlier Versions
</h3>
<p>
The main changes from the final beta-test release
GAP&nbsp;4 beta 5 are in
the documentation and in performance, both of which are much improved and
in the fixing of many bugs. The installation process has also been
improved a little, and there are some new algorithms, especially in the
areas of semigroups and finitely-presented groups. As far as we know any
programs that worked with 4 beta 5 should still work in
GAP&nbsp;4.1.
</p><p>
The changes since the final release of GAP&nbsp;3
(version 3.4.4) are much
more wide-ranging. The general philosophy of the changes is two-fold.
Firstly, many assumptions in the design of GAP&nbsp;3
revealed its authors'
primary interest in group theory, and indeed in finite group
theory. Although much of the GAP&nbsp;4 library is concerned
with groups,
the basic design now allows extension to other algebraic structures, as
witnessed by the inclusion of substantial bodies of algorithms for
computation with semigroups and Lie algebras. Secondly, as the scale of
the system, and the number of people using and contributing to it has
grown, some aspects of the underlying system have proved to be
restricting, and these have been improved as part of comprehensive
re-engineering of the system. This has included the new method selection
system, which underpins the library, and a new, much more flexible, share
package interface.
</p><p>
Details of these changes can be found in chapter "Migrating to
GAP&nbsp;4" of
this manual. It is perhaps worth mentioning a few points here.
</p><p>
Firstly, much remains unchanged, from the perspective of the mathematical
user:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  The syntax of that part of the GAP language that most
  users need for investigating mathematical problems.
</li><li>
  The great majority of function names.
</li><li>
  Data libraries and the access to them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A number of visible aspects have changed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Some function names that need finer specifications now that there are
  more structures available in GAP.
</li><li>
  The access to information already obtained about a mathematical
  structure. In GAP&nbsp;3 such information about a group
  could be looked up by directly inspecting the group record, whereas
  in GAP&nbsp;4 functions must be used to access such
  information.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Behind the scenes, much has changed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  A new kernel, with improvements in memory management and in
  the language interpreter, as well as new features such as saving of
  workspaces and the possibility of compilation of GAP
  code into C.
</li><li>
  A new structure to the library, based upon a new type and
  method selection system, which is able to support a broader range of
  algebraic computation and to make the structure of the library simpler
  and more modular.
</li><li>
  New and faster algorithms in many mathematical areas.
</li><li>
  Data structures and algorithms for new mathematical objects, such as
  algebras and semigroups.
</li><li>
  A new and more flexible structure for the GAP installation
  and documentation, which means, for example, that a share package and
  its documentation can be installed and be fully usable without any changes
  to the GAP system.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A very few features of GAP&nbsp;3 are not yet available in
GAP&nbsp;4.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Only a few of the GAP&nbsp;3 share packages have yet been
  converted for use with GAP&nbsp;4 (although several new
  packages are available only in GAP&nbsp;4).
</li><li>
  The Galois group determination algorithms which were
  implemented in the GAP&nbsp;3 library are not present in
  GAP&nbsp;4.
</li><li>
  The algorithms for the factorization of polynomials over
  algebraic number fields which were implemented in the
  GAP&nbsp;3 library
  are not present in GAP&nbsp;4.
</li><li>
  The library of crystallographic groups which was present in
  GAP&nbsp;3 is now part of a share package 'crystcat', which
  has been submitted for refereeing and is distributed with this release
  as a "preprint".
</li><li>
  The library of irreducible maximal finite integral matrix
  groups is not yet available.
</li><li>
  The p-quotient and soluble quotient algorithms are implemented in the
  GAP&nbsp;4 library, but those implementations are not
  yet described in the documentation. If you have a pressing need to use
  them, please contact 'gap-trouble'.
</li>
</ul>
