<mixertitle>Preface of <mixer var="GAP"/> 3.1</mixertitle>

<p>
<mixer var="GAP"/> stands for <b>Groups, Algorithms and Programming</b>.
The name was chosen to reflect the aim of the system, which is introduced
in this manual.
</p><p>
Until well into the eighties the interest of pure mathematicians in
computational group theory was stirred by, but in most cases also
confined to the information that was produced by group theoretical
software for their special research problems -- and hampered by the
uneasy feeling that one was using black boxes of uncontrollable
reliability. However the last years have seen a rapid spread of interest
in the understanding, design and even implementation of group theoretical
algorithms. These are gradually becoming accepted both as standard tools
for a working group theoretician, like certain methods of proof, and as
worthwhile objects of study, like connections between notions expressed
in theorems.
</p><p>
<mixer var="GAP"/> was started as an attempt to meet this interest.
Therefore a
primary design goal has been to give its user full access to algorithms
and the data structures used by them, thus allowing critical study as
well as modification of existing methods. We also intend to relieve the
user from unwanted technical chores and to assist him in the programming,
thus supporting invention and implementation of new algorithms as well as
experimentation with them.
</p><p>
We have tried to achieve these goals by a design which in addition makes
<mixer var="GAP"/> easily portable, even to computers such as Atari ST
and Amiga, and at the same time facilitates the maintenance of
<mixer var="GAP"/> with the limited resources of an academic environment.
</p><p>
While I had felt for some time rather strongly the wish for such a truly
<b>open</b> system for computational group theory, the concrete idea of
<mixer var="GAP"/>
was born when, together with a larger group of students, among whom where
Johannes Meier, Alice Niemeyer, Werner Nickel and Martin
Schönert who eventually wrote the first version of <mixer var="GAP"/>, I
had my first contact with the Maple system at the EUROCAL meeting in
Linz/Austria in 1985. Maple demonstrated to us the feasibility of a
strong and efficient computer algebra system built from a small kernel,
with an interpreted library of routines written in a problem-adapted
language. The discussion of the plan of a system for computational group
theory organized in a similar way started in the fall of 1985,
programming only in the second half of 1986. A first version of
<mixer var="GAP"/>
was operational by the end of 1986. The system was first presented at
the Oberwolfach meeting on computational group theory in May 1988.
Version 2.4 was the first officially to be given away from Aachen
starting in December 1988. The strong interest in this version, in spite
of its still rather small collection of group theoretical routines, as
well as constructive criticism by many colleagues, confirmed our belief
in the general design principles of the system. Nevertheless over three
years have gone by until now in April 1992 version 3.1 is released.
</p><p>
A main reason for this much time and the fact that there have not been
intermediate releases is that we have found it advisable to make a number
of changes to basic data structures until we now hope to have reached a
state where we can maintain upward compatibility over further releases,
which are planned to follow much more frequently. Of course the time has
also been used to extend the scope of the methods implemented in
<mixer var="GAP"/>.
A rough guess puts the size of the present program library at about eight
times the size of that in version 2.4. In spite of this there are still
very notable gaps in what I would like to see in <mixer var="GAP"/>.
</p><p>
The system that you are getting now consists of four parts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  A comparatively small <b>kernel</b>, written in C, which provides the user
  with:
  <ul>
  <li>
    automatic dynamical storage management, which the user needn't
    bother about in his programming;
  </li><li>
    a set of time-critical basic functions, e.g. "arithmetic"
    operations for integers, finite field elements, permutations and words,
    as well as natural operations for lists and records;
  </li><li>
    an interpreter for the <mixer var="GAP"/> language, which belongs to the
    Pascal family, but, while allowing additional types for group
    theoretical objects, does not require type declarations;
  </li><li>
    a set of programming tools for testing, debugging, and
    timing algorithms.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  A much larger <b>library</b> of <mixer var="GAP"/> functions that
  implement group
  theoretical and other algorithms. Since this is written entirely in the
  <mixer var="GAP"/> language, in contrast to the situation in older group
  theoretical software, the <mixer var="GAP"/> language is both the main
  implementation language
  and the user language of the system. Therefore the user can as easily as
  the original programmers investigate and vary algorithms of the library
  and add new ones to it, first for his own and eventually for the benefit
  of all <mixer var="GAP"/> users. We hope that moreover the structuring of
  the library using the concept of 'domains' and the techniques used for
  their handling that have been introduced into <mixer var="GAP"/>&nbsp;3.1
  by Martin Schönert will be further helpful in this respect.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  A <b>library of group theoretical data</b> which already contains e.g. a
  list of primitive groups of Charles Sims, a list of the 2-groups of order
  up to 256 of Eamonn O'Brien and a large collection of character tables
  including all of the Cambridge 'Atlas of Finite Groups', but which we
  hope to extend further with the help of colleagues who have undertaken
  larger classifications of groups.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  The <b>documentation</b>. This is available as a file that can either be
  used for on-line help or be printed out to form this manual. Some advice for
  using this manual may be helpful. The first chapter
  'About <mixer var="GAP"/>' is
  really an introduction to the use of the system, starting from scratch
  and, for the beginning, assuming neither much knowledge about group
  theory nor much versatility in using a computer. Some of the later
  sections of chapter 1 assume more, however. For instance, the section
  'About Character Tables' definitely assumes familiarity with
  representation theory of finite groups, while in particular the sections
  'About the Implementation of Domains' to 'About Defining New Group
  Elements' address more advanced users who want to extend the system to
  meet their special needs. The further chapters of the manual give then a
  full description of the functions presently available in <mixer var="GAP"/>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The policy for the further development of <mixer var="GAP"/> is to keep
the kernel as
small as possible, extending the set of basic functions only by very
selected ones that have proved to be time-critical and, wherever
feasible, of general use. In the interest of the possibility of
exchanging functions written in the <mixer var="GAP"/> language the kernel
has to be maintained in a single place which in the foreseeable future will
be Aachen. On the other hand we hope that the design of <mixer var="GAP"/>
will allow
the library to grow not only by continued work in Aachen but, as does any
other part of mathematics, by exchange of contributions from many sides.
Our own plans in this respect in the near future include the removal of
present restrictions on the degree of permutations and the size of finite
fields, the implementation of some further standard methods for working
with finite presentations, such as Reidemeister-Schreier and Tietze
transformations, extension of the methods for permutation groups, some
further tools for working with character tables, and better interactive
means of working with the output of the subgroup lattice program. Some
of this has already been implemented and just did not make it for the
deadline that we had set for inclusion with this release.
</p><p>
There are five other points to make on further policy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  When we began work on <mixer var="GAP"/> the typical user that we had
  in mind was the
  one wanting to implement his own algorithmic ideas. While we certainly
  hope that we still serve such users well it has become clear from the
  experience of the last years that there are even more users of two
  different species, on the one hand the established theoretician,
  sometimes with little experience in the use of computers, who wants an
  easily understandable tool, on the other hand the student, often quite
  familiar with computers, who wants to get assistance in learning the
  theory by being able to do nontrivial examples. We think that in fact
  <mixer var="GAP"/> can well be used by both, but we realize that for
  each a special introduction would be desirable. We apologize that we
  have not had the time yet to write such.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  When we began work on <mixer var="GAP"/>, we designed it as a system for
  doing <b>group
  theory</b>. It has already turned out that in fact the design of the system
  is general enough, and some of its functions are also useful, for doing
  work in other neighbouring areas. For instance Leonard Soicher has used
  <mixer var="GAP"/> to develop a system GRAPE for working with graphs.
  We certainly
  enjoy seeing this happen, but we want to emphasize that our primary
  interest is the development of a group theory system and that we do not
  plan to try to extend it beyond our abilities into a general computer
  algebra system.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  Rather we hope to provide tools for linking <mixer var="GAP"/> to other
  systems that
  represent years of work and experience in areas such as commutative
  algebra, or, even in the near future, to very efficient special purpose
  stand-alone programs such as the p-group generation program of Mike
  Newman and Eamonn O'Brien.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  We invite you to extend <mixer var="GAP"/>. We are willing to make such
  extensions available through the same channels as <mixer var="GAP"/>
  in the form of a <b>share library</b>. Of course, we will do this only
  if the extension can be distributed free of charge like <mixer var="GAP"/>.
  The copyright for such extensions shall remain with you.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  Finally to answer an often asked question: The <mixer var="GAP"/>
  language is in principle designed to be compilable. We may one day try
  writing a compiler for it, but this is not yet under way.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<mixer var="GAP"/> is given away under the conditions that have always been
in use between mathematicians, i.e. in particular <b>completely in source</b>
and <b>free of charge</b>. We hope that the possibility offered by modern
technology of depositing <mixer var="GAP"/> on a number of computers to be
fetched from them by 'ftp', will assist us in this policy. We want to
emphasize, however, two points. <mixer var="GAP"/> is <b>not</b> public
domain software; we want to
maintain a <b>copyright</b> that in particular forbids commercialization of
<mixer var="GAP"/>. Further we ask that use of <mixer var="GAP"/> be quoted
in publications like the use of any other mathematical work, and we would
be grateful if we could keep track of where <mixer var="GAP"/> is implemented.
Therefore we ask you to notify us if you have got <mixer var="GAP"/>, e.g.,
by sending a short e-mail message
to 'gap@samson.math.rwth-aachen.de'. The simple reason, on top of our
curiousity, is that as anybody else in an academic environment we have
from time to time to prove that we are doing meaningful work.
</p><p>
We have established a <mixer var="GAP"/> forum, where interested users can
discuss
<mixer var="GAP"/> related topics by e-mail. In particular this forum is for
questions about <mixer var="GAP"/>, general comments, bug reports, and maybe
bug fixes. We will read this forum and answer questions and comments, and
distribute bug fixes. Of course others are also invited to answer
questions, etc. We will also announce future releases of <mixer var="GAP"/>
on this forum.
</p><p>
To subscribe send an e-mail message to
'listserv@samson.math.rwth-aachen.de' containing the line 'subscribe
gap-forum &lt;your-name&gt;', where &lt;your-name&gt; should be your full
name, not your e-mail address. You will receive an acknowledgement, and from
then on all e-mail messages sent to 'gap-forum@samson.math.rwth-aachen.de'.
</p><p>
'listserv@samson.math.rwth-aachen.de' also accepts the following
requests. 'help' for a short help on how to use 'listserv', 'unsubscribe
gap-forum' to unsubscribe, 'recipients gap-forum' to get a list of
subscribers, and 'statistics gap-forum' to see how many e-mail messages
each subscriber has sent so far.
</p><p>
<mixer var="GAP"/> was started as a joint Diplom project of four students
whose names have already been mentioned. Since then about 10 finished Diplom
projects have contributed to <mixer var="GAP"/> and further students are
presently extending the library in the course of their work for the Diplom
as well as other members of Lehrstuhl D and colleagues from other institutes.
Their individual contributions to the programs and to the manual are
documented in the respective files. To all of them as well as to all who
have helped proofreading and improving this manual I want to express my
thanks for their engagement and enthusiasm. Very special thanks however
go to Martin Schönert. Not only does <mixer var="GAP"/> owe many of its
basic design features to his profound knowledge of computer languages and
the techniques for their implementation, but in many long discussions he
has in the name of future users always been the strongest defender of
clarity of the design against my impatience and the temptation for
"quick and dirty" solutions.
</p><p>
As with version 2.4 we send this version out hoping for feedback of
constructive criticism. Of course we ask to be notified about bugs, but
moreover we shall appreciate any suggestion for the improvement of the
basic system as well as of the algorithms in the library. Most of all,
however, we hope that in spite of such criticism you will enjoy working
with <mixer var="GAP"/>.
</p>
Aachen, March 31, 1992, Joachim Neubüser.
