<p>
Welcome to the first release of GAP from St Andrews. In the
two years since the release of GAP&nbsp;3.4.3, most of the
efforts of the GAP team in Aachen have been devoted to the
forth-coming major release, GAP&nbsp;4.1, which will feature
a re-engineered kernel with
many extra facilities, a completely new scheme for structuring the
library, many new and enhanced algorithms and algorithms for new
structures such as algebras and semigroups.
</p><p>
While this was going on, however, our users were not idle, and a
number of bugs and blemishes in the system were found, while a
substantial number of new or improved share packages have been
submitted and accepted. Once it was decided that the computational
algebra group at St Andrews would take over GAP development,
we agreed, as a learning exercise, to release a new upgrade of
GAP&nbsp;3.4, incorporating the bug fixes and new packages.
</p><p>
Assembling the release has indeed been a learning experience, and has,
of course, taken much longer than we hoped. The release incorporates
fixes to all known bugs in the library and kernel. In addition, there
are two large new data libraries: of transitivie permutation groups up
to degree 23; and of all groups of order up to 1000, except those of
order 512 or 768 and some others have been extended. This release
includes a number of share packages that are new since 3.4.3:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>autag</dt>
<dd>
  for computing the automorphism groups of soluble groups;
</dd>
<dt>CHEVIE</dt>
<dd>
  for computing with finite Coxteter groups, Hecke algebras, Chevalley
  groups and related structures, replacing 'weyl';
</dd>
<dt>CrystGap</dt>
<dd>
  for computing with crystallographic groups;
</dd>
<dt>glissando</dt>
<dd>
  for comnputing with near-rings and semigroups;
</dd>
<dt>grim</dt>
<dd>
  for computing with rational and integer matrix groups;
</dd>
<dt>kbmag</dt>
<dd>
  linking to Knuth-Bendix package for monoids and groups;
</dd>
<dt>matrix</dt>
<dd>
  for analysing matrix groups over finite fields, replacing 'smash' and
  'classic';
</dd>
<dt>pcqa</dt>
<dd>
  linking to a polycyclic quotient program;
</dd>
<dt>specht</dt>
<dd>
  for computing the representation theory of the symmetric group and
  related structures; and
</dd>
<dt>xmod</dt>
<dd>
  for computing with crossed modules.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
A number of other share packages have also been updated. Full details
of all of these can be found in the updated manual, which is now also
supplied in an HTML version.
</p><p>
Despite the tribulations of this release, we are looking forward to
taking over a central role in GAP development in the future,
and to working with the users and contributors who are so essential a part
of making GAP what it is.
