<p>
GAP stands for <b>Groups, Algorithms and Programming</b>.
The name was chosen to reflect the aim of the system, which is introduced
in this manual.
</p><p>
Until well into the eighties the interest of pure mathematicians in
computational group theory was stirred by, but in most cases also
confined to the information that was produced by group theoretical
software for their special research problems -- and hampered by the
uneasy feeling that one was using black boxes of uncontrollable
reliability. However the last years have seen a rapid spread of interest
in the understanding, design and even implementation of group theoretical
algorithms. These are gradually becoming accepted both as standard tools
for a working group theoretician, like certain methods of proof, and as
worthwhile objects of study, like connections between notions expressed
in theorems.
</p><p>
GAP was started as an attempt to meet this interest.
Therefore a
primary design goal has been to give its user full access to algorithms
and the data structures used by them, thus allowing critical study as
well as modification of existing methods. We also intend to relieve the
user from unwanted technical chores and to assist him in the programming,
thus supporting invention and implementation of new algorithms as well as
experimentation with them.
</p><p>
We have tried to achieve these goals by a design which in addition makes
GAP easily portable, even to computers such as Atari ST
and Amiga, and at the same time facilitates the maintenance of
GAP with the limited resources of an academic environment.
</p><p>
While I had felt for some time rather strongly the wish for such a truly
<b>open</b> system for computational group theory, the concrete idea of
GAP
was born when, together with a larger group of students, among whom were
Johannes Meier, Werner Nickel, Alice Niemeyer, and Martin
Schönert who eventually wrote the first version of GAP, I
had my first contact with the Maple system at the EUROCAL meeting in
Linz/Austria in 1985. Maple demonstrated to us the feasibility of a
strong and efficient computer algebra system built from a small kernel,
with an interpreted library of routines written in a problem-adapted
language. The discussion of the plan of a system for computational group
theory organized in a similar way started in the fall of 1985,
programming only in the second half of 1986. A first version of
GAP
was operational by the end of 1986. The system was first presented at
the Oberwolfach meeting on computational group theory in May 1988.
Version 2.4 was the first officially to be given away from Aachen
starting in December 1988. The strong interest in this version, in spite
of its still rather small collection of group theoretical routines, as
well as constructive criticism by many colleagues, confirmed our belief
in the general design principles of the system. Nevertheless over three
years had passed until in April 1992 version 3.1 was released, which was
followed in February 1993 by version 3.2, in November 1993 by version 3.3
and is now in June 1994 followed by version 3.4.
</p><p>
A main reason for the long time between versions 2.4 and 3.1 and the fact
that there had not been intermediate releases was that we had found it
advisable to make a number of changes to basic data structures until with
version 3.1 we hoped to have reached a state where we could maintain
upward compatibility over further releases, which were planned to follow
much more frequently. Both goals have been achieved over the last two
years. Of course the time has also been used to extend the scope of the
methods implemented in GAP. A rough estimate puts the size
of the program library of version 3.4 at about sixteen times the size of
that of version 2.4, while for version 3.1 the factor was about eight.
Compared to GAP&nbsp;3.2, which was the last version with major
additions, new features of GAP&nbsp;3.4 include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  New data types (and extensions of methods) for algebras,
  modules and characters
</li> 
<li> 
  Further methods for working with finite presentations
  (IMD, a fast size function)
</li>
<li>
  Some "Almost linear", methods and (rational) conjugacy
  classes for permutation groups
</li>
<li>
  Methods based on "special AG systems", for finite soluble groups
</li>
<li>
  A package for the calculation of Galois groups and field extensions
</li>
<li>
  Extensions of the library of data (transitive permutation
  groups, crystallographic groups)
</li>
<li>
  An X-window based X-GAP for display of subgroup lattices
</li>
<li>
  Five further share libraries (ANU SQ, MEATAXE, SISYPHOS,
  VECTORENUMERATOR, SMASH)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Work on the extension of GAP is going on in Aachen as well
as in an increasing number of other places. We hope to be able to have the
next release of GAP after about 9 months again, that is in
the first half of 1995.
</p><p>
The system that you are getting now consists of four parts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  A comparatively small <b>kernel</b>, written in C, which provides the user
  with:
  <ul>
  <li>
    automatic dynamic storage management, which the user needn't
    bother about in his programming;
  </li><li>
    a set of time-critical basic functions, e.g. "arithmetic",
    operations for integers, finite field elements, permutations and words,
    as well as natural operations for lists and records;
  </li><li>
    an interpreter for the GAP language, which belongs to the
    Pascal family, but, while allowing additional types for group
    theoretical objects, does not require type declarations;
  </li><li>
    a set of programming tools for testing, debugging, and
    timing algorithms.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  A much larger <b>library of GAP functions</b> that implement
  group theoretical and other algorithms. Since this is written entirely in
  the GAP language, in contrast to the situation in older
  group theoretical software, the GAP language is both the
  main implementation language
  and the user language of the system. Therefore the user can as easily as
  the original programmers investigate and vary algorithms of the library
  and add new ones to it, first for own use and eventually for the benefit
  of all GAP users. We hope that moreover the structuring of
  the library using the concept of 'domains' and the techniques used for
  their handling that have been introduced into GAP&nbsp;3.1
  by Martin Schönert will be further helpful in this respect.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  A <b>library of group theoretical data</b> which already contains various
  libraries of groups (cf. chapter 'Group Libraries'), large libraries of
  ordinary character tables, including all of the Cambridge 'Atlas of
  Finite Groups' and modular tables (cf. chapter 'Character Table
  Libraries'), and a library of tables of marks. We hope to extend this
  collection further with the help of colleagues who have undertaken larger
  classifications of groups.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  The <b>documentation</b>. This is available as a file that can either be
  used for on-line help or be printed out to form this manual. Some advice
  for using this manual may be helpful. The first chapter
  'About GAP' is
  really an introduction to the use of the system, starting from scratch
  and, for the beginning, assuming neither much knowledge about group
  theory nor much versatility in using a computer. Some of the later
  sections of chapter 1 assume more, however. For instance section 'About
  Character Tables' definitely assumes familiarity with representation
  theory of finite groups, while in particular sections 'About the
  Implementation of Domains' to 'About Defining New Group Elements' address
  more advanced users who want to extend the system to meet their special
  needs. The further chapters of the manual give then a full description
  of the functions presently available in GAP.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Together with the system we distribute
<b>GAP share libraries</b>, which are
separate packages which have been written by various groups of people and
remain under their responsibility. Some of these packages are written
completely in the GAP language, others totally or in parts
in C (or even other languages). However the functions in these packages can
be called directly from GAP and results are returned to
GAP. At present there are 10 such share libraries
(cf. chapter "Share Libraries").
</p><p>
The policy for the further development of GAP is to keep the
kernel as
small as possible, extending the set of basic functions only by very
selected ones that have proved to be time-critical and, wherever
feasible, of general use. In the interest of the possibility of
exchanging functions written in the GAP language the kernel
has to be
maintained in a single place which in the foreseeable future will be
Aachen. On the other hand we hoped from the beginning that the design of
GAP would allow the library of GAP functions
and the library of
data to grow not only by continued work in Aachen but, as does any other
part of mathematics, by contributions from many sides, and these hopes
have been fulfilled very well.
</p><p>
There are some other points to make on further policy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  When we began work on GAP the typical user that we had in
  mind was the
  one wanting to implement his own algorithmic ideas. While we certainly
  hope that we still serve such users well it has become clear from the
  experience of the last years that there are even more users of two
  different species, on the one hand the established theorist, sometimes
  with little experience in the use of computers, who wants an easily
  understandable tool, on the other hand the student, often quite familiar
  with computers, who wants to get assistance in learning the theory by
  being able to do nontrivial examples. We think that in fact
  GAP can
  well be used by both, but we realize that for each a special introduction
  would be desirable. We apologize that we have not had the time yet to
  write such, however have learned (through the GAP forum)
  that in a
  couple of places work on the development of Laboratory Manuals for the
  use of GAP alongside with standard Algebra texts is
  undertaken.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  When we began work on GAP, we designed it as a system for
  doing <b>group theory</b>.
  It has already turned out that in fact the design of the system
  is general enough, and some of its functions are also useful, for doing
  work in other neighbouring areas. For instance Leonard Soicher has used
  GAP to develop a system GRAPE for working with graphs, which
  meanwhile is available as a share library. We certainly enjoy seeing
  this happen, but we want to emphasize that in Aachen our primary interest
  is the development of a group theory system and that we do not plan to
  try to extend it beyond our abilities into a general computer algebra
  system.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  Rather we hope to provide tools for linking GAP to other
  systems that
  represent years of work and experience in areas such as commutative
  algebra, or to very efficient special purpose stand-alone programs. A
  link of this kind exists e.g. to the MOC system for the work with modular
  characters.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  We invite you to further extend GAP. We are willing either
  to include such extensions into GAP or to make them
  available through the same channels as GAP in the form of
  the above mentioned share libraries.
  Of course, we will do this only if the extension can be distributed free
  of charge like GAP. The copyright for such share libraries
  shall remain with you.
  <br />&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
  Finally to answer an often asked question: The GAP
  language is in
  principle designed to be compilable. Work on a compiler is on the way,
  but this is not yet ready for inclusion with this release.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
GAP is given away under the conditions that have always been
in use
between mathematicians, i.e. in particular <b>completely in source</b> and
<b>free of charge</b>. We hope that the possibility offered by modern
technology of depositing GAP on a number of computers to be
fetched
from them by 'ftp', will assist us in this policy. We want to emphasize,
however, two points. GAP is <b>not</b> public domain
software; we want to
maintain a <b>copyright</b> that in particular forbids commercialization of
GAP. Further we ask that use of GAP be quoted
in publications like
the use of any other mathematical work, and we would be grateful if we
could keep track of where GAP is implemented. Therefore we
ask you to
notify us if you have got GAP, e.g., by sending a short
e-mail message
to 'gap@samson.math.rwth-aachen.de'. The simple reason, on top of our
curiosity, is that as anybody else in an academic environment we have
from time to time to prove that we are doing meaningful work.
</p><p>
We have established a GAP forum, where interested users can
discuss
GAP related topics by e-mail. In particular this forum is for
questions about GAP, general comments, bug reports, and maybe
bug fixes. We will read this forum and answer questions and comments, and
distribute bug fixes. Of course others are also invited to answer
questions, etc. We will also announce future releases of GAP
in this forum.
</p><p>
To subscribe send an e-mail message to 'miles@samson.math.rwth-aachen.de'
containing the line 'subscribe gap-forum &lt;your-name&gt;', where
&lt;your-name&gt;
should be your full name, not your e-mail address. You will receive an
acknowledgement, and from then on all e-mail messages sent to
'gap-forum@samson.math.rwth-aachen.de'.
</p><p>
'miles@samson.math.rwth-aachen.de' also accepts the following
requests. 'help' for a short help on how to use 'miles', 'unsubscribe
gap-forum' to unsubscribe, 'recipients gap-forum' to get a list of
subscribers, and 'statistics gap-forum' to see how many e-mail messages
each subscriber has sent so far.
</p><p>
The reliability of large systems of computer programs is a well known
general problem and, although over the past year the record of
GAP in
this respect has not been too bad, of course GAP is not
exempt from
this problem. We therefore feel that it is mandatory that we, but also
other users, are warned of bugs that have been encountered in
GAP or when doubts have arisen. We ask all users of
GAP to use the GAP forum for issuing such
warnings.
</p><p>
We have also established an e-mail address 'gap-trouble' to which
technical problems of a more local character such as installation
problems can be sent. Together with some experienced GAP
users abroad we try to give advice on such problems.
</p><p>
GAP was started as a joint Diplom project of four students
whose names have already been mentioned. Since then many more finished Diplom
projects have contributed to GAP as well as other members
of Lehrstuhl
D and colleagues from other institutes. Their individual contributions
to the programs and to the manual are documented in the respective files.
To all of them as well as to all who have helped proofreading and
improving this manual I want to express my thanks for their engagement
and enthusiasm as well as to many users of GAP who have
helped us by
pointing out deficiencies and suggesting improvements. Very special
thanks however go to Martin Schönert. Not only does GAP
owe many of its basic design features to his profound knowledge of
computer languages and the techniques for their implementation, but in
many long discussions he has in the name of future users always been the
strongest defender of clarity of the design against my impatience and the
temptation for "quick and dirty", solutions.
</p><p>
Since 1992 the development of GAP has been financially
supported by
the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in the context of the
Forschungsschwerpunkt "Algorithmische Zahlentheorie und Algebra".
This very important help is gratefully acknowledged.
</p><p>
As with the previous versions we send this version out hoping for further
feedback of constructive criticism. Of course we ask to be notified
about bugs, but moreover we shall appreciate any suggestion for the
improvement of the basic system as well as of the algorithms in the
library. Most of all, however, we hope that in spite of such criticism
you will enjoy working with GAP.
</p>
Aachen, June 1, 1994, Joachim Neubüser.
