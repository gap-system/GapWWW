<h3>
  Preface for the first beta release of GAP&nbsp;4
</h3>

<p>
The transition from GAP&nbsp;3.4 which got its presumably
last update 3.4.4 in April this year to this present first beta release
GAP&nbsp;4.B.1 of GAP&nbsp;4 marks a major
step in the system design of GAP, similar in importance to
the step from GAP&nbsp;2.4 to GAP&nbsp;3.1 in
April 1992 on which I comment in my preface to GAP&nbsp;3.4
of June 1994. However in contrast to the situation in 1992
we hope that the changes will be much less bothering to the majority of
the GAP users this time. Let me first talk about some reasons
and background for developing GAP&nbsp;4 and then briefly
sketch what remains and what changes.
</p><p>
The planning of GAP&nbsp;4 started already at the time of
the release of GAP&nbsp;3.4 (Summer 1994) and its development
has been a major reason for the fact that since then only updates (up to
GAP&nbsp;3.4.4) but no new releases of
GAP&nbsp;3 have come out. Also a number of new algorithms
have been implemented in Aachen anticipating GAP&nbsp;4 and
hence have not become generally available yet.
</p><p>
There were three major reasons for the development of
GAP&nbsp;4:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  There has been a growing demand to implement new mathematical structures
  in GAP (Lie algebras are just one example). However
  GAP&nbsp;3 was not really designed for such tasks.
</li><li>
  The number and diversity of (sometimes competing) algorithmic methods
  is growing rapidly. We definitely want to maintain the principle
  that the user should be able to control what methods are used.
  However, the growing complexity of the interrelation of algorithms
  makes it mandatory to have also a 'method selection' mechanism which
  controls the choice between different possibilities to proceed within
  a GAP function, that is at least partially guided by already
  computed knowledge about the objects under investigation.
</li><li>
  While the two points mentioned above have caused 'visible' changes
  from GAP&nbsp;3 to GAP&nbsp;4, in this
  transition also important changes
  have taken place 'behind the scene'. There are e.g. improvements of
  the storage management and function calls, and last not least a
  compiler from GAP&nbsp;4 to C is part of this beta release.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So regarding system aspects let's briefly sketch:
</p><p>
What is left unchanged?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  The syntax of that part of the GAP language that most
  users need investigating mathematical problems.
</li><li>
  The great majority of function names.
</li><li>
  Data libraries and the access to them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What has changed?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Some function names that need finer specifications now that there are
  more structures available in GAP.
</li><li>
  The access to information already obtained about a mathematical
  structure. E.g. in GAP&nbsp;3 such information about a
  group could be looked up by directly inspecting the group record, whereas
  in GAP&nbsp;4 functions must be used to access such
  information.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What is new?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  A whole machinery for the definition of new structures.
</li><li>
  A hopefully clearer separation of aspects of knowledge about the
  mathematical objects that GAP handles by the introduction
  of the concepts of attributes, families, categories, and representations.
</li><li>
  A number of new structures, such as Lie algebras.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Then to the mathematical functionality provided by GAP&nbsp;4
in comparison to GAP&nbsp;3:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Almost all of the program library of GAP&nbsp;3 has been
  transferred to GAP&nbsp;4. Some of this had just to be
  adapted to the new features
  (which in itself has been a huge job in view of the size of the
  program library), but for quite a few tasks the opportunity has been
  used to implement new and more efficient algorithms - notably so e.g.
  for permutation groups and polycyclic groups.
</li><li>
  A number of new algorithms have been implemented for which the features of
  GAP&nbsp;4 proved more adequate or even necessary and which
  are now made public in GAP for the first time.
</li><li>
  One main deficiency of the present beta release is that the meanwhile large
  library of share packages of GAP&nbsp;3 has not yet been
  transferred.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The other main deficiency is that there is not yet a complete manual for
GAP&nbsp;4.
</p><p>
It is intended to provide eventually at least four books as parts of the
manual. The first and second are intended for people who want to use
GAP "as is". Books 3 and 4 on the other hand are meant for
people who want to extend GAP&nbsp;4 by introducing new
structures. Books 1 and 3 are tutorials for the respective purpose while
Books 2 and 4 are the corresponding reference manuals.
</p><p>
Of these four books a good deal of Books 1 and 3, i.e. the tutorial
parts, are provided with this release, while there are only rudimentary
parts of books 2 and 4 available. For people already familiar with
GAP&nbsp;3 the chapter "Migrating to
GAP&nbsp;4" in the first book may be particularly helpful.
</p><p>
There have been (weekly changing) alpha test versions of
GAP&nbsp;4 since December 1996, and a number of specially
experienced GAP users in addition to the GAP
teams at Aachen and St. Andrews have used these
and provided helpful criticism and suggestions. It is envisaged that
there will be new beta releases from now on about every couple of months
until an official version GAP&nbsp;4.1 can be released next
year. It is
hoped that these further beta releases will gradually provide the missing
parts mentioned above as well as further enhancements. However, since the
date of the official handover of GAP from Aachen to
St. Andrews has now been fixed to be July 21, 1997, this further development
will happen under the responsibility of St. Andrews.
</p><p>
It remains to me to thank all those who have done the huge amount of work
that was needed to bring GAP&nbsp;4 on its way. Many basic
ideas for the
new concepts as well as most of the new kernel implementation are still
due to Martin Schönert before and even in parts after he left
Lehrstuhl D fuer Mathematik. However together with him while he was
still working here and continuing after he left, Thomas Breuer and Frank
Celler have in long discussions found the way to the concepts and done
crucial parts of the new implementations. Many others have worked
adapting and rewriting the library, of whom I want to mention in
particular Bettina Eick, Alexander Hulpke and Heiko Theissen from the
Aachen team but also acknowledge the help lended already for some time
from St. Andrews, in particular by Steve Linton.
</p><p>
To these and all others, whom I did not mention explicitly, I want to
express my thanks for a yearlong cooperation in a spirit of enthusiasm,
dedication and perseverance. I wish the team at St. Andrews a successful
continuation of the development and maintenance of GAP in
that same spirit and all users fun and success in using GAP.
