  As the <a href="/Doc/Bib/bib.html">Bibliography</a> shows,
  <mixer var="GAP"/> has been used in a wide variety of areas of
  mathematics. On this page we first provide some direct links to
  examples that are intended to give a flavour of the use of
  <mixer var="GAP"/>. Pointers to some further sources of examples are
  given <a href="#below">below</a>.

    <a href="rubik.html">
    <b> Analyzing Rubik's Cube with <mixer var="GAP"/> </b></a> <br />
    An updated <mixer var="GAP4"/> version of a <mixer var="GAP3"/>
    example by <mixer person="Martin Schoenert" data="name"/>, 1993.
    An almost classical permutation group of small degree is examined
    with some elementary <mixer var="GAP"/> commands.

  <li>
    <a href="cavicchioli.html">
    <b> Two fundamental groups from A. Cavicchioli </b></a> <br />
    This example demonstrates some methods for the investigation of finitely
    presented groups using two presentations of fundamental groups due to
    A. Cavicchioli.

    <a href="mcl.html"> <b>Lifting a quotient of type McL of a finitely
    presented group</b></a> <br />
    An example by <mixer person="Alexander Hulpke" data="name"/>
    demonstrating how a known (non-solvable) quotient of a finitely
    presented group can be extended with sovable normal subgroups.
    <br />&nbsp;

  <li>
    <a href="balanced.html"> <b>Balanced presentations for covering
    groups of simple groups</b></a> <br />
    An example that demonstrates how the deficiency of some perfect
    groups may be determined by a program PGRelFind using
    <mixer var="GAP"/> together with the 
    <span class="sansserif">ACE</span> package. 2001.

    <b> A solvable subgroup of Fi<sub>23</sub> </b></a> <br />
    In this example from the Diploma thesis of
    <mixer person="Alexander Hulpke" data="name"/> a solvable maximal
    subgroup of Fi<sub>23</sub> is constructed using information from
    the ATLAS.

  <li>
    <a href="co3.html"> <b> Constructing HS and Co3 </b></a> <br />
    This is a <mixer var="GAP4"/> version of the last example in the paper
    "<em>Construction of Co3. An example of the use of an integrated system
    for Computational Group Theory</em>", Groups St Andrews 1997 in Bath,
    by <mixer person="Alexander Hulpke" data="name"/> and

    Using a function provided by 
    <mixer person="Bettina Eick" data="name"/> a p-group with rather 
    special properties of lower and upper central series, requested in 
    a Forum letter, is constructed and investigated, also using XGAP 
    to depict the lattice of its normal subgroups.
