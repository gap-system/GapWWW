<p>
  As the <a href="/Doc/Bib/bib.html">Bibliography</a> shows,
  GAP has been used in a wide variety of areas of
  mathematics. On this page we first provide some direct links to
  examples that are intended to give a flavour of the use of
  GAP. Pointers to some further sources of examples are
  given <a href="#below">below</a>.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="rubik.html">
    <b> Analyzing Rubik's Cube with GAP </b></a> <br />
    An updated GAP&nbsp;4 version of a GAP&nbsp;3
    example by Martin Schönert, 1993.
    An almost classical permutation group of small degree is examined
    with some elementary GAP commands.
    <br />&nbsp;
  </li> 

  <li>
    <a href="cavicchioli.html">
    <b> Two fundamental groups from A. Cavicchioli </b></a> <br />
    This example demonstrates some methods for the investigation of finitely
    presented groups using two presentations of fundamental groups due to
    A. Cavicchioli.
    <br />&nbsp;

  <li>
    <a href="mcl.html"> <b>Lifting a quotient of type McL of a finitely
    presented group</b></a> <br />
    An example by Alexander Hulpke
    demonstrating how a known (non-solvable) quotient of a finitely
    presented group can be extended with sovable normal subgroups.
    <br />&nbsp;
  </li> 

  <li>
    <a href="balanced.html"> <b>Balanced presentations for covering
    groups of simple groups</b></a> <br />
    An example that demonstrates how the deficiency of some perfect
    groups may be determined by a program PGRelFind using
    GAP together with the 
    <span class="sansserif">ACE</span> package. 2001.
    <br />&nbsp;
  </li> 

  <li>
    <a href="grigorchuk.html">
    <b> Quotients of Grigorchuk's group </b></a> <br />
    Investigation of some factor groups of a group of automorphisms of
    a binary tree defined by R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Grigorchuk.
    <br />&nbsp;
  </li> 

  <li>
    <a href="fischer.html">
    <b> A solvable subgroup of Fi<sub>23</sub> </b></a> <br />
    In this example from the Diploma thesis of
    Alexander Hulpke a solvable maximal
    subgroup of Fi<sub>23</sub> is constructed using information from
    the ATLAS.
    <br />&nbsp;
  </li> 

  <li>
    <a href="co3.html"> <b> Constructing HS and Co3 </b></a> <br />
    This is a GAP&nbsp;4 version of the last example in the paper
    "<em>Construction of Co3. An example of the use of an integrated system
    for Computational Group Theory</em>", Groups St Andrews 1997 in Bath,
    by Alexander Hulpke and Steve Linton.
    <br />&nbsp;
  </li>
 
  <li>
    <a href="p-group.html"> <b>A p-Group with Special Properties</b></a> <br />
    Using a function provided by Bettina Eick a p-group with rather 
    special properties of lower and upper central series, requested in 
    a Forum letter, is constructed and investigated, also using XGAP 
    to depict the lattice of its normal subgroups.
