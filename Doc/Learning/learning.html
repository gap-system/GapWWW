<p>
  GAP can answer simple questions or be a tool for experts.
  We have collected here links to a variety of materials intended to help
  people learn the language and get what they want from GAP.
  See also the page on
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/Teaching/teaching.html">Teaching&nbsp;Material</a>,
  which refers to material accompanying courses given at various places. 
</p>
<p>
  Some of these materials have been written as stand-alone introductions to
  GAP, others were prepared to accompany talks at conferences.
  We have tried in each case to indicate the level and the intended audience.
</p>
<p>
  There is considerable overlap in the content of the various materials,
  particularly in their introductory sections. We suggest that you look at
  several accounts, both to discover which are most suited to your
  background and interests, and to see some different ways that people think
  about GAP.
</p>
<p>
  Of course everything about GAP is contained in the
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/manuals.html">manuals</a> where it is explained in detail,
  but since already the main
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Manuals/doc/ref/chap0.html">
  Reference&nbsp;Manual</a> is so extensive we recommend that you look
  briefly at its table of contents first, then start to learn
  GAP with some of the basic materials here. If you can,
  start GAP in one computer window and open the written
  material in another, so you can cut and paste and experiment as you go
  along.
  Later, when you start to run your first own jobs, you may either continue
  to use GAP interactively or write programs to be saved and
  then executed. The latter has the advantage that such programs can easily
  be modified and rerun.
</p>
<p>
  We wish you an enjoyable and rewarding experience learning
  GAP.

    objects interactively to saving the code into files, creating functions 
    and regression tests, searching in the Small Groups Library and extending 
    the system by adding new attributes.
