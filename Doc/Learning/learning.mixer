<mixertitle>Learning <mixer var="GAP"/></mixertitle>

<p>
  <mixer var="GAP"/> can answer simple questions or be a tool for experts.
  We have collected here links to a variety of materials intended to help
  people learn the language and get what they want from <mixer var="GAP"/>.
  See also the page on
  <a href="/Doc/Teaching/teaching.html">Teaching&nbsp;Material</a>,
  which refers to material accompanying courses given at various places. 
</p>
<p>
  Some of these materials have been written as stand-alone introductions to
  <mixer var="GAP"/>, others were prepared to accompany talks at conferences.
  We have tried in each case to indicate the level and the intended audience.
</p>
<p>
  There is considerable overlap in the content of the various materials,
  particularly in their introductory sections. We suggest that you look at
  several accounts, both to discover which are most suited to your
  background and interests, and to see some different ways that people think
  about <mixer var="GAP"/>.
</p>
<p>
  Of course everything about <mixer var="GAP"/> is contained in the
  <a href="/Doc/manuals.html">manuals</a> where it is explained in detail,
  but since already the main
  <a href="{{GAPManualLink}}/doc/ref/chap0.html">
  Reference&nbsp;Manual</a> is so extensive we recommend that you look
  briefly at its table of contents first, then start to learn
  <mixer var="GAP"/> with some of the basic materials here. If you can,
  start <mixer var="GAP"/> in one computer window and open the written
  material in another, so you can cut and paste and experiment as you go
  along.
  Later, when you start to run your first own jobs, you may either continue
  to use <mixer var="GAP"/> interactively or write programs to be saved and
  then executed. The latter has the advantage that such programs can easily
  be modified and rerun.
</p>
<p>
  We wish you an enjoyable and rewarding experience learning
  <mixer var="GAP"/>.
