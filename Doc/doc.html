<p>
  There is a lot of written material telling about the functionality
  and use of GAP, providing information about algorithmic
  background and giving hints for writing own GAP code.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h3>
  <a href="manuals.html">Manuals</a>
</h3>
<p>
  For the users of GAP we provide a
  <a href="{{ site.docsurl }}/doc/tut/chap0.html">Tutorial</a>
  giving a first introduction to the system and a
  <a href="{{ site.docsurl }}/doc/ref/chap0.html">
  Reference&nbsp;Manual</a>
  with complete descriptions of all library functions and examples of
  their use. Most essential changes from previous GAP 
  releases are described in the document called
  <a href="{{ site.docsurl }}/doc/changes/chap0.html">
  'Changes from Earlier Versions'</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Each GAP package has its individual manual which you can
  access through the list of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Packages/packages.html">Packages</a>.
  A list of pointers to all these package manuals is also given on the page
  <a href="manuals.html">Manuals</a>.

<li>
<h3>
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/Learning/learning.html">Learning&nbsp;GAP</a>
</h3>
<p>
  In addition to the
  <a href="{{ site.docsurl }}/doc/tut/chap0.html">Tutorial</a>
  mentioned above there is a variety of material intended to help people
  to learn on their own the GAP language and the use of
  the GAP system. We have tried to organize links to such
  material somewhat according to the level and intended audience on the
  page quoted in the heading.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/Teaching/teaching.html">Teaching&nbsp;Material</a>
</h3>
<p>
  GAP has been used in several places to support the
  teaching of a variety of courses. We are grateful to the colleagues
  who allowed us to point to some course material of such courses and
  we would appreciate to obtain access to further such material.
  We hope that this can be helpful to colleagues intending a
  similar use of GAP, but it may also be used by
  students studying the topics of such courses.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/applications.html">Applications</a>
</h3>
<p>
   On this page we have collected links to  descriptions of various
   applications of GAP, some of them in rather unexpected 
   areas.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/Examples/examples.html">Examples</a>
</h3>
<p>
  Some examples of the use of GAP from papers and talks,
  contributed by different authors, have been worked out in detail and
  are listed on the page quoted in the heading. Of course, the examples
  of this list cover only a small part of the functionality of
  GAP. You can find many further ones by browsing
  through the GAP
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/forumarchive.html">Forum&nbsp;Archive</a>,
  in the slides and handouts of
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/Talks/talks.html">Talks</a>,
  and in the papers listed in the
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/Bib/bib.html">Bibliography</a>
  of publications quoting GAP.

<h3>
  The GAP
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/forumarchive.html">Forum&nbsp;Archive</a>
</h3>
<p>
  The correspondence that has taken place in the
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/Forum/forum.html">GAP&nbsp;Forum</a>
  has been kept in the Forum Archive.
  A good deal of this correspondence concerns questions how to solve
  problems using GAP and the answers given by other users
  or developers. These may be of help for further problems. The
  GAP Forum Archive can be searched by date, senders'
  names, or certain keywords. Note that in particular early Forum
  correspondence is likely to concern GAP&nbsp;3 rather than
  GAP&nbsp;4.

<li>
<h3>
  Some <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/Talks/talks.html">Talks&nbsp;and&nbsp;Preprints</a>
</h3>
<p>
  This is a collection of some preprints of papers as well as handouts
  and slides from talks related to GAP or, in a few cases,
  more widely to computational group theory. Note that some earlier of
  these texts still refer to GAP&nbsp;3 rather than
  GAP&nbsp;4.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>
  The GAP <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/Bib/bib.html">Bibliography</a>
</h3>
<p>
  We maintain a bibliography of papers citing GAP. Some of
  these papers describe applications of GAP, others
  algorithmic methods that are implemented in GAP. We hope
  that looking at these papers will be helpful for users and we ask that
  you help us to keep this bibliography up to date by sending us the
  bibliographical data of your own publications citing GAP.
  Please have a look at the page on
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/publicationfeedback.html">feedback</a>.
  Note that some of the listed papers may still refer to use of
  GAP&nbsp;3 rather than GAP&nbsp;4.

<h3>
  <a href="references.html">References</a> for Methods of Computational
  Group Theory
</h3>
<p>
  This offers some information on the mathematical background of the
  methods implemented in GAP and its packages. It provides
  some annotated references to books and survey articles on computational
  group theory and neighbouring fields.
</p>

<h3>
  <a href="History/history.html">
  Some&nbsp;History&nbsp;of&nbsp;GAP</a>
</h3>
<p>
  The 'History' page provides some documents (prefaces of previous
  releases and 'Interim Reports') that mark steps of the development of
  GAP.
