<p>
 See also the page on
 <a href="/Doc/Learning/learning.html">Learning&nbsp;GAP</a>,
 which refers to material that may help you if you want to learn 
 GAP on your own or to teach it.
</p>
<p>
  GAP has been used in lecture courses of various levels,
  both for providing examples and for creating teaching material, in
  particular exercises. We recently conducted a survey on this topic,
  and its results are published on the
  <a href="http://education.lms.ac.uk/2012/03/gap-in-teaching/">LMS De Morgan Forum</a>.
</p>
<p>
  However, it is not always the case that
  such teaching materials are available to the public. We therefore
  ask to inform <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">The GAP Group</a>
  if you have such material and are willing to share it with others.
</p>
<p>
  At present we can point to the following material.

    A lab manual

    Joseph&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Gallian
    containing a collection of exercises that use GAP
    and are appropriate for a first course in abstract algebra.
    This manual was originally developed to be used with Gallian's book   
    <em>Contemporary Abstract Algebra</em>).
