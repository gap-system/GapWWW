<p>
     This package is no longer redistributed with GAP 
     because the servers it crucially relies on for its functionality have been permanently retired 
     (see <a href="https://mail.gap-system.org/pipermail/gap/2019-March/001155.html">this announcement</a>). 
     Its source code repository, containing the code of the last distributed version, can still be found on GitHub 
     <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/qaos">here</a>. 
     If somebody is interested in repairing this package 
     and taking over its maintenance, so that it can be distributed again, please contact the GAP team.
