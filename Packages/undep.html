title: Undeposited Implementations for GAP
layout: default
toc: Packages
---

<p>On this page we collect references to algorithms that have been 
implemented in GAP in the course of research projects.
This collection ranges from undeposited packages (which may or may not
eventually appear among <a href="packages.html">deposited packages</a>)
to rather special purpose implementations whose authors preferred not to 
invest the extra effort necessary to turn them into packages. Some of 
these programs were developed a while ago and are not guaranteed to work
with the latest version of GAP.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in some of these implementations, and no links to the 
downloads or descriptions are given, then please contact the authors directly.

The package provides routines for the construction and the

simplicial homology with integer coefficients. Since calculation
of simplicial homology with integers coefficients involves the
calculation of the Smith normal form of sparse integer matrices,
the package provides independent functionality for the calculation
of the Smith normal form.

<b> SeDiMO, a program for computing the secant dimensions of minimal
orbits such as Grassmannians and Segre products</b>
<br/>
Description: A semisimple complex algebraic group G has a unique closed
orbit on the projective space PV, if V is an irreducible G-module. Many
interesting algebraic varieties arise as such "minimal orbits", for
instance, Grassmannians and Segre products. These minimal orbits are
notoriously hard to prove non-defective in the sense that all higher
secant varieties have the expected dimension. This program (that 
can be found on the author's website)
computes the secant dimensions of these minimal orbits.

<b>Enumeration of p-Groups</b>
<a name="EnumPgroups"/>
<br/>
This algorithm can be used to enumerate all p-groups of a given
order (up to isomorphism). The basic ideas of the algorithm are
similar to the p-group generation algorithm (see the
<a href ="/Packages/anupq.html">ANUPQ</a> Package).
But instead of listing all p-groups of a given order explicitly,
this algorithm only counts the number of such p-groups and counting
is usually faster than listing. This algorithm has been used in
the determination of the number of groups of order 2^9 and 2^10.

<b> Computing uniserial p-adic space groups</b>

This algorithm can be used to determine all unserial p-adic space
groups of a given dimension up to isomorphism (p an odd prime).
The uniserial p-adic space groups of coclass at most r and their
finite central extensions correspond to the infinite branches in
the graph of all finite p-groups of coclass r. This algorithm
has been used to determine all uniserial 3-adic space groups of
<a href="http://www-public.tu-bs.de:8080/~beick/soft/coclass/coclass.tar.gz">coclass</a> at most 4.

<br/>
This algorithm constructs all subgroups of the symmetric group of degree
<i>n</i>, assuming knowledge of the primitive groups of degree <i>n</i> and
the transitive groups of all degrees dividing <i>n</i>.
It has been used to construct the libraries of

<b>PLANAR - testing graphs for planarity</b>
<br>
PLANAR is the program for the computational algebra system GAP. Its main 
purpose is testing whether the given graph is planar. PLANAR 
also requires the GAP package GRAPE, since it uses some of its 
functionality for graphs. In particular, note that you can check whether 
the graph is connected using the GRAPE function IsConnectedGraph. Also the
graph must be non-oriented, without loops and multiple edges. Note that
these features of graph do not imply on its planarity, so you can easily
reduce the problem to the graph, understandable by PLANAR. Download formats:

Nerves of categories</a></b>
<br/>
A collection of routines to handle representations and cohomology, of 
groups and more generally of categories. The code computes the 
(co)homology of nerves of categories. Regarding a group as a category, 
we obtain the usual group cohomology, but the routines presented here
are not efficient for this. Regarding a poset as a category we get the 
homology of the order complex. Every simplicial complex may be given up 
to homeomorphism in this fashion.

<b><a href="http://www.math.umn.edu/~webb/GAPfiles/">
Software to compute with finite group representations over fields 
of positive characteristic</a></b>
<br/>
In these routines the information about a group representation which is stored 
is the group being represented, and a list of matrices which give the action 
of the group generators. The routines allow the user to compute submodule 
structure and perform various operations. The main computational philosophy 
is to take fixed points, thereby computing homomorphisms between modules, 
socles, radicals, etc. This is arguably distinct from the philosophy behind 
the meataxe, for example. Thus in the case of representations of p-groups in 
characteristic p there may be very many submodules  of a module which would 
be time consuming for the meataxe to enumerate. The approach taken here produces 
socle and radical series more directly (and not just for p-groups).

Some optional interfaces to GAP are listed below for the user's information.
However, they are not officially supported by the GAP suport team and may not work on all
operating systems.

<b>GGAP</b>: For a GUI version of GAP, check out GGAP written by Yevgen Muntyan:

<b>Sage</b>: The <a href="http://sagemath.org/">Sage</a> <a href="http://sagenb.org/">notebook</a> interface provides a GUI for GAP. 
If you are running the notebook remotely (e.g., on sagenb.org) then select GAP from the drop-down menu near the top of the browser's page for a worksheet.
If you are running the sage notebook locally, type

<pre>
sage: notebook("gap",open_viewer=True,system="gap")
</pre>

This does three things:

<ol>
<li>
puts the banner "gap" on your worksheet (it does not save or name your worksheet "gap" though),
</li>
<li>
opens firefox (or a new tab if firefox is already running) and starts a sage notebook interface running there,
</li>
<li>
makes every input box "gap command only". 
</li>
</ol>
