<p>
     This package has been unusable (it does not compile) for several years preceding GAP 4.10 release, and is unmaintained. 
     It was therefore dropped from the GAP package distribution. 
     If anybody is willing to take over and fix the package, the latest sources are available
     <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/linboxing">here</a>
