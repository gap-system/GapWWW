<p>
  Since 1992,  sets of  user contributed programs,  called <i>packages</i>,
  have been  distributed with  GAP. For  convenience of
  the GAP users, the  GAP Group redistributes
  packages,  but  the  package   authors  remain  responsible  for  their
  maintenance.
</p>

<p>
  There is a designated and documented mechanism for loading packages into
  GAP including a smooth integration of the documentation
  into the GAP help system. (See 
  <a href="Authors/authors.html">this page</a> for hints how to write 
  your own package and the reference manual
  {% include ref.html manual="Reference: Using and Developing GAP Packages" text="chapter" %}
  about installing and loading packages.)
</p>

<p>
  Some packages  represent a  piece of work  equivalent to  a sizeable
  mathematical publication. To acknowledge such  work there has been a
  refereeing  process  for  packages  since 1996.  See
  <a href="/Contacts/submit.html">
  Submitting&nbsp;Contributions&nbsp;to&nbsp;GAP</a>
  for  more information on this. We call a package an
  <i>accepted package</i> (with GAP&nbsp;3 the term
  <i>share packages</i> was used) when it was succesfully refereed or
  already distributed with GAP before the refereeing
  process was started. All other packages distributed here and not in
  this category are called <i>deposited packages</i>, these may be
  submitted for refereeing or the authors may not want to submit them
  for various reasons.
</p>

<p>
This page lists current versions of GAP packages 
redistributed with GAP, and the page 
<a href="/Doc/manuals.html">Manuals</a> informs about presently 
available package manuals.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested to find GAP packages hosted on GitHub or 
BitBucket, please see <a href="http://gap-packages.github.io/">this page</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are familiar with the previous GAP distributions, 
note that now we do not distribute a merged archive of all currently
redistributed packages. All these packages are now included in the same
archive with the core GAP system, adding a significant 
amount of functionality. Dependencies between packages are illustrated
by the following 
<a href="https://alexk.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/gap/GAP_Packages.html">graph</a>.
Each package is also available in a single archive which may be used e.g. 
for a later upgrading, though the recommented way to upgrade the system 
is just to reinstall it as explained on the 
<a href="../Download/upgrade.html">upgrade page</a>.

as well as the list of (individually authored and/or maintained) 
<a href="/Contacts/People/modules.html">'Modules'</a>,
into which a large part of the GAP library is divided .

<h2>Accepted Packages
<a name="accpkg"></a></h2>

<p>
Here is the current list of <i>accepted packages</i>. They are either 
redistributed by the GAP Group since before the refereeing
process was setup, or they have been successfully refereed.
The packages are sorted alphabetically, except for some data library
packages, given in a separate list.
</p>
<p>
Follow the links to find brief descriptions of each package, as well as
further information including download and installation instructions.
</p>

<!-- Accepted packages -->
{% include_relative PackageList/accepted.html %}

<p><a name="datalibpkgs"></a>
  The  following  packages mainly  contain  and/or  provide access  to
  data  libraries.  
  <!-- HOPEFULLY SOON:
  See section  <a  href="/Datalib/datalib.html">Data
  Libraries</a> for more details. -->
  These  are either refereed and accepted
  packages or they were a part of the GAP library which is
  now separated into a package.
</p>

<!-- Data libraries -->
{% include_relative PackageList/data_libraries.html %}


<h2>Deposited Packages
<a name="deppkg"></a></h2>

<p>
Some of the following packages  may be refereed and moved into
the section on accepted packages later, others will not be submitted for
refereeing.

No longer redistributed with GAP or renamed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carat - this package has been renamed to
     <a href="/Packages/caratinterface.html">CaratInterface</a>.</li>
  <li>Citrus - this package has been renamed to
     <a href="/Packages/semigroups.html">Semigroups</a>.</li>
  <li>Convex - this package has been superseded by
     <a href="/Packages/nconvex.html">NConvex</a>.</li>
  <li>Gpd - this package has been renamed to
     <a href="/Packages/groupoids.html">groupoids</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="/Packages/happrime.html">HAPprime</a> - part of 
     the code has been incorporated into the
     <a href="/Packages/hap.html">HAP</a> package. 
     Its source code repository, containing the code of the 
     last distributed version, can still be found on GitHub
     <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/happrime">here</a>.</li>
  <li>if - this package has been withdrawn; a better 
     functionality is now included in the newer package
     <a href="/Packages/scscp.html">SCSCP</a>.</li>
  <li>LAG - the functionality of this package is now included
    in the newer package <a href="/Packages/laguna.html">LAGUNA</a>.</li>
  <li>linboxing - this package has been unusable (it does not compile) for
    several years preceding GAP&nbsp;4.10 release,
    and is unmaintained. It was therefore dropped from the GAP
    package distribution. If anybody is willing to take over and fix the
    package, the latest sources are available
    <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/linboxing">here</a>.</li>
  <li>MONOID - the functionality of this package is now included in the
     newer package <a href="/Packages/semigroups.html">Semigroups</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="/Packages/nql.html">NQL</a> - this package has been
    withdrawn by the author, and later has been superseded by
    the package <a href="/Packages/lpres.html">lpres</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="/Packages/pargap.html">ParGAP</a> is no longer redistributed with
    GAP because it no longer can be compiled with GAP 4.9 (see 
    <a href="https://mail.gap-system.org/pipermail/gap/2018-March/001082.html">this announcement</a>).
    Its source code repository, containing the code of the last distributed version, 
    plus some first fixes needed for compatibility for GAP 4.9,
    can still be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/pargap">here</a>.
    If somebody is interested in repairing this package and taking over its 
    maintenance, so that it can be distributed again, please contact the GAP team.</li>
  <li><a href="/Packages/qaos.html">QaoS</a> is no longer redistributed with
    GAP because the servers it crucially relies on for 
    its functionality have been permanently retired (see 
    <a href="https://mail.gap-system.org/pipermail/gap/2019-March/001155.html">this announcement</a>).
    Its source code repository, containing the code of the last distributed version, 
    can still be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/qaos">here</a>.
    If somebody is interested in repairing this package and taking over its 
    maintenance, so that it can be distributed again, please contact the GAP team.</li>
  <li>recogbase - this package has been merged into the
     <a href="/Packages/recog.html">recog</a> package, and
     therefore is no longer distributed with GAP.</li>
</ul>
