  Description
</h3>
<p>
The SmallGroups Library contains all groups of certain 'small' orders.
The word 'Small' is used to mean orders less than a certain bound and
orders whose prime factorisation is small in some sense. The groups are 
sorted by their orders and they are listed up to isomorphism; that is, 
for each of the available orders a complete and irredundant list of 
isomorphism type representatives of groups is given. Currently, the
library contains the following groups:
</p>
<ul>
 <li> those of order at most 2000 except 1024 (423 164 062 groups); </li>
 <li> those of cubefree order at most 50 000  (395 703 groups); </li>
 <li> those of order p<sup>7</sup> for the primes p = 3,5,7,11 (907 489 groups); </li>
 <li> those of order p<sup>n</sup> for n <= 6 and all primes p; </li>
 <li> those of order q<sup>n</sup> * p where q<sup>n</sup> divides 
2<sup>8</sup>, 3<sup>6</sup>, 5<sup>5</sup> or 7<sup>4</sup>
   and p is an arbitrary prime not equal to q; </li>
 <li> those of squarefree order; </li>
 <li> those whose order factorises into at most 3 primes. </li>
</ul>

<p>
The library also has an identification function: it returns the library
number of a given group. Currently, this function is available for all
orders in the library except for the orders 512 and 1536 and except for
the orders p<sup>5</sup>, p<sup>6</sup> and p<sup>7</sup> above 2000. 
</p>
<p>
The library is organised in 11 layers. Each layer contains the groups of
certain orders and their corresponding group identification routines. It
is possible to install the first n layers of the group library and the
first m layers of the group identification for each 1 &le; m &le; n 
&le; 11. In summary, the layers are:

<ul>
  <li> the groups whose order factorises into at most 3 primes. </li>
  <li> the remaining groups of order at most 1000 except 512 and 768. </li>
  <li> the remaining groups of order 2<sup>n</sup> * p with n &lt; 9 and p an odd
       prime. </li>
  <li> the groups of order 5<sup>5</sup> and 7<sup>4</sup> and the remaining groups of order
       q<sup>n</sup> * p where q<sup>n</sup> divides 3<sup>6</sup>, 5<sup>5</sup> or 
7<sup>4</sup> and p is a prime with p
       not equal to q. </li>
  <li> the remaining groups of order at most 2000 except 1024, 1152, 1536
       and 1920. </li>
  <li> the groups of orders 1152 and 1920. </li>
  <li> the groups of order 512. </li>
  <li> the groups of order 1536. </li>
  <li> the remaining groups of order p<sup>4</sup>, p<sup>5</sup> and p<sup>6</sup>. </li>
  <li> the remaining groups of squarefree order and of cubefree order
       at most 50000. </li>
  <li> the remaining groups of order p<sup>7</sup> for p = 3,5,7,11.  </li>
</ul>
