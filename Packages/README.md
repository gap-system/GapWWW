# PLEASE DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY

This contains static html sites in `Packages/Authors/*` and `Packages/Contrib/*`
subdirectories.

The `packages.html` site is the main page and in particular lists all packages from `_Packages/*`
that get autogenerated by a script.

The `undep.html` site lists all undeposited packages.

The script `etc/generate_package_yml_files_from_PackageInfo_files.sh` generates package lists in `_Packages/*`.

The other `.html` files here are packages that either got renamed or are broken.
