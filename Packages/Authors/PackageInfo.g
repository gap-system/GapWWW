##  PackageInfo.g for the package `Example'                     Werner Nickel
##                                                                Greg Gamble
##  (created from Frank Lübeck's PackageInfo.g template file)
##  
##  This is a GAP readable file. Of course you can change and remove all
##  comments as you like.
##  
##  This file contains meta-information on the package. It is used by
##  the package loading mechanism and the upgrade mechanism for the
##  redistribution of the package via the GAP website.
##  
##  Entries that are commented out are based on the EDIM package and 
##  are there for purposes of illustration of a possible alternative,
##  especially in the case where the Example package's entry is blank.
##  
##  For the LoadPackage mechanism in GAP >= 4.5 the minimal set of needed
##  entries is .PackageName, .Version, and .AvailabilityTest, and an error
##  will occur if any of them is missing. Other important entries are
##  .PackageDoc and .Dependencies. The other entries are relevant if the
##  package will be distributed for other GAP users, in particular if it
##  will be redistributed via the GAP Website.
##
##  With a new release of the package at least the entries .Version, .Date 
##  and .ArchiveURL must be updated.

SetPackageInfo( rec(

##  This is case sensitive, use your preferred spelling.

PackageName := "Example",

##  This may be used by a default banner or on a Web page, should fit on
##  one line.
Subtitle := "Example/Template of a GAP Package and Guidelines for Package Authors",

##  See '?Extending: Version Numbers' in GAP help for an explanation
##  of valid version numbers. For an automatic package distribution update
##  you must provide a new version number even after small changes.
Version := "3.4.2",
##  Release date of the current version in dd/mm/yyyy format.
##
Date := "02/06/2012",
##  Optional: if the package manual uses GAPDoc, you may duplicate the 
##  version and the release date as shown below to read them while building
##  the manual using GAPDoc facilities to distibute documents across files.

      LowercaseString( ~.PackageName ), "/" ),

##  URL of the archive(s) of the current package release, but *without*
##  the format extension(s), like '.tar.gz' or '-win.zip', which are given next.
##  The archive file name *must be changed* with each version of the archive
##  (and probably somehow contain the package name and version).
##  The paths of the files in the archive must begin with the name of the
##  directory containing the package (in our "example" probably:
##  example/init.g, ...    or example-3.3/init.g, ...  )
# 
ArchiveURL := Concatenation( ~.PackageWWWHome, "example-", ~.Version ),

##  All provided formats as list of file extensions, separated by white
##  space or commas.
##  Currently recognized formats are:
##      .tar.gz    the UNIX standard
##      .tar.bz2   compressed with 'bzip2', often smaller than with gzip
##      -win.zip   zip-format for DOS/Windows, text files must have DOS 
##                 style line breaks (CRLF)
##  
##  In the future we may also provide .deb or .rpm formats which allow
##  a convenient installation and upgrading on Linux systems.
##  
# ArchiveFormats := ".tar.gz", # the others are generated automatically
ArchiveFormats := ".tar.gz",

##  If not all of the archive formats mentioned above are provided, these 
##  can be produced at the GAP side. Therefore it is necessary to know which
##  files of the package distribution are text files which should be unpacked
##  with operating system specific line breaks. 
##  The package wrapping tools for the GAP distribution and web pages will
##  use a sensible list of file extensions to decide if a file 
##  is a text file (being conservative, it may miss a few text files). 
##  These rules may be optionally prepended by the application of rules 
##  from the PackageInfo.g file. For this, there are the following three
##  mutually exclusive possibilities to specify the text files:
##  
##    - specify below a component 'TextFiles' which is a list of names of the 
##      text files, relative to the package root directory (e.g., "lib/bla.g"),
##      then all other files are taken as binary files.
##    - specify below a component 'BinaryFiles' as list of names, then all other
##      files are taken as text files.
##    - specify below a component 'TextBinaryFilesPatterns' as a list of names
##      and/or wildcards, prepended by 'T' for text files and by 'B' for binary
##      files.
##  
##  (Remark: Just providing a .tar.gz file will often result in useful
##  archives)
##  
##  These entries are *optional*.
#TextFiles := ["init.g", ......],
#BinaryFiles := ["doc/manual.dvi", ......],
#TextBinaryFilesPatterns := [ "TGPLv3", "Texamples/*", "B*.in", ......],


##  Information about authors and maintainers is contained in the `Persons'
##  field which is a list of records, one record for each person; each 
##  person's record should be as per the following example: 
##  
##     rec(
##     # these are compulsory, the strings can be encoded in UTF-8 or latin1,
##     # so using German umlauts or other special characters is ok:

##  
##     # At least one of the following three entries must be given 
##     # for each maintainer of the package:

##  For a central overview of all packages and a collection of all package
##  archives it is necessary to have two files accessible which should be
##  contained in each package:
##     - A README file, containing a short abstract about the package
##       content and installation instructions.
##     - The PackageInfo.g file you are currently reading or editing!
##  You must specify URLs for these two files, these allow to automate 
##  the updating of package information on the GAP Website, and inclusion
##  and updating of the package in the GAP distribution.
#
README_URL := 
  Concatenation( ~.PackageWWWHome, "README" ),
PackageInfoURL := 
  Concatenation( ~.PackageWWWHome, "PackageInfo.g" ),

##  Here you  must provide a short abstract explaining the package content 
##  in HTML format (used on the package overview Web page) and an URL 
##  for a Webpage with more detailed information about the package
##  (not more than a few lines, less is ok):
##  Please, use '<span class="pkgname">GAP</span>' and
##  '<span class="pkgname">MyPKG</span>' for specifing package names.

   package. It has little functionality except for being a package, however, \
   it contains an extensive appendix with guidelines for package authors.",

##  Here is the information on the help books of the package, used for
##  loading into GAP's online help and maybe for an online copy of the 
##  documentation on the GAP website.
##  
##  For the online help the following is needed:
##       - the name of the book (.BookName)
##       - a long title, shown by ?books (.LongTitle, optional)
##       - the path to the manual.six file for this book (.SixFile)
##  
##  For an online version on a Web page further entries are needed, 
##  if possible, provide an HTML- and a PDF-version:
##      - if there is an HTML-version the path to the start file,
##        relative to the package home directory (.HTMLStart)
##      - if there is a PDF-version the path to the .pdf-file,
##        relative to the package home directory (.PDFFile)
##      - give the paths to the files inside your package directory
##        which are needed for the online manual (as a list 
##        .ArchiveURLSubset of names of directories and/or files which 
##        should be copied from your package archive, given in .ArchiveURL 
##        above (in most cases, ["doc"] or ["doc","htm"] suffices).
##  
##  For links to other GAP or package manuals you can assume a relative 
##  position of the files as in a standard GAP installation.
##  
# in case of several help books give a list of such records here:
PackageDoc := rec(
  # use same as in GAP            
  BookName  := "Example",
  # format/extension can be one of .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, -win.zip, .zoo.
  ArchiveURLSubset := ["doc"],
  HTMLStart := "doc/chap0.html",
  PDFFile   := "doc/manual.pdf",
  # the path to the .six file used by GAP's help system
  SixFile   := "doc/manual.six",
  # a longer title of the book, this together with the book name should
  # fit on a single text line (appears with the '?books' command in GAP)
  # LongTitle := "Elementary Divisors of Integer Matrices",
  LongTitle := "Example/Template of a GAP Package",

##  store messages which may be viewed later with `DisplayPackageLoadingLog'.
##  Do not call `Print' or `Info' in the `AvailabilityTest' function of the 
##  package.
##
##  With the package loading mechanism of GAP >=4.4, the availability
##  tests of other packages, as given under .Dependencies above, will be
