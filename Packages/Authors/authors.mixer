<mixertitle>Information for <mixer var="GAP"/> Package Authors</mixertitle>

<p>
If you have written or are going to write programs which enhance the 
functionality of <mixer var="GAP"/> in some area, you may consider
organizing and maybe distributing your code in form of a <mixer
var="GAP"/> package. Here is a collection of information for package
authors or maintainers.
(You may also consult the package
<a href="/Packages/example.html">Example</a> or just look what other
package authors have done.)
</p>

<h3>Getting Started Writing a Package</h3>
<p>
The <mixer var="GAP"/>  documentation contains a 
<mixer manual="Reference: Using GAP Packages">chapter</mixer> 
on using <mixer var="GAP"/> packages.
All advice on developing <mixer var="GAP"/> packages has been consolidated in 
the <a href="/Packages/example.html">Example</a> package. 
</p>

<p>
The interface between <mixer var="GAP"/> and a <mixer var="GAP"/>
package consists of two or three files <code>PackageInfo.g</code>, 
<code>init.g</code> and <code>read.g</code>. The first of these contains
meta information on a package for loading and (possibly) distribution. 
Probably the easiest way to create it is to fill out this <a
href="PackageInfo.g"><code>PackageInfo.g</code> template file</a> (which
has detailed comments on each entry). The latest version of this template
may also be found in the <a href="/Packages/example.html">Example</a> package.
</p>
<p>
As the number of packages and library modules in GAP grows, it is important to
try to avoid clashes where two independently developed pieces of code use the
same global  variable names in inconsistent ways.  See the page 
<a href="/Packages/Authors/variablenames.html">Use&nbsp;of&nbsp;Global&nbsp;Variable&nbsp;Names</a> 
as well as the subsection 
<mixer manual="Example: Functions and Variables and Choices of Their Names">
Functions&nbsp;and&nbsp;Variables&nbsp;and&nbsp;Choices&nbsp;of&nbsp;Their&nbsp;Names</mixer>
of the manual of the <a href="/Packages/example.html">Example</a> package
for advice how to avoid such 'name clashes'.
</p>

<h3> Do Not Change <mixer var="GAP"/>'s Behaviour in a Package</h3>
<p>
It is generally a bad idea for a package to change the behaviour of
the core functionality of <mixer var="GAP"/>, as opposed to extending it, 
or implementing better algorithms to compute the same results. For instance,
if you believe that you can improve the way some kind of <mixer var="GAP"/>
 object is printed, then please
suggest this improvement by an email to support@gap-system.org (by all means
include your code), rather than simply implementing it in your package.
</p>
<p>
There are two reasons for this. Firstly, it can surprise users who may not
even know they are using your package (perhaps some other package loaded it).
Secondly, we have a variety of tools for testing <mixer var="GAP"/> releases
and they work much better if the output produced by "standard" 
<mixer var="GAP"/> commands is the same with and without packages.
</p>
<p>
For similar reasons, we would also ask that packages refrain from assigning
names to indeterminates, or otherwise changing the appearance of common
objects.
</p>


<h3>Making Your Package Available to Other <mixer var="GAP"/> Users</h3>

<p>
Once a package works and has documentation of its functionality, you
should consider to distribute it for interested <mixer var="GAP"/>
users. Of course, you can just do it on your own, say via a web page.
In this case we would like to hear about the availability of the
package, please write a hint to <a
href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another possibility is to redistribute your package via the web and ftp
site of <mixer var="GAP"/> itself. If you want that, also contact us as
just stated. The <mixer var="GAP"/> Group will check if your package
provides some new or improved functionality which looks interesting for
other users, if it contains  reasonable documentation, and if it seems
to work smoothly with the <mixer var="GAP"/> library and other
distributed packages. In this case the package can take part in the
distribution update mechanism described below. It becomes a
<em>deposited</em> package.
</p>
<p>
Please, check if your package would be appropriate for our <a 
href="/Contacts/submit.html">refereeing process</a>. If yes,
we encourage you to submit it! After successful refereeing the package
becomes an <em>accepted</em> package.
</p>

<h3>Writing Documentation for Your Package</h3>

<p>
An  essential feature  of any <mixer var="GAP"/> package is  that it
should   have   documentation  which   works   smoothly  with   
<mixer var="GAP"/>'s on-line  help. There  are a number  of possible  
ways of achieving this.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, and the way we recommend, you can use the 
<a href="/Packages/gapdoc.html">GAPDoc</a> package 
which allows you to write documentation in a concise and well-specified
XML-like language. This documentation can then be processed using GAPDoc to
produce on-line help, printed manuals and web pages.
(To get machine independent cross-links in your documentation, copy
your package in the standard location <code>pkg/&lt;pkgname&gt;</code>
and use <mixer manual="GAPDoc: MakeGAPDocDoc"><code>MakeGAPDocDoc</code></mixer>
with <code>../../..</code> as 5th argument.) 
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can use the "traditional" GAP4 manual format, i.e. TeX 
with some additional macros, which, provided you use it carefully, can be
processed directly by <mixer var="GAP"/> as on-line help, processed 
by TeX for printing and processed by a perl script provided in the 
"tools" archive to make HTML. This format is partly
documented in the document "The gapmacro.tex Manual Format" 
which is included in the ``tools'' archive contained in the
<code>etc</code> directory of the <mixer var="GAP"/> installation.
(Here, also copy your package in the standard location 
<code>pkg/&lt;pkgname&gt;</code> when building the HTML 
version of your manual to get cross-links right.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, you can develop your own solution, complying with the interfaces
described in chapter 
<mixer manual="Reference: Interface to the GAP Help System"/> 
of the programmers reference manual. There are
certain technical issues with this approach, and we would advise you to
contact us if you are considering it.
</p>


<h3>Choosing a License for the Distribution of Your Package</h3>

<p>
We would advise all package authors to make clear in the documentation of
their package the basis on which it is being distributed to users.
Technically, this is the terms of the license which you give the users to
copy, modify and redistribute 
your software (of which you presumably own the copyright) for their purposes.
GAP itself is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2, a popular
"free software" license which allows users to redistribute it freely under the
same terms, and requires that any software which incorporates GAP
(technically, any "derived work") also be distributed under those terms. We
would encourage you to consider the GPL for your packages, but you might wish
to be more restrictive (for instance forbidding redistribution for profit) or
less restrictive (allowing your software to be incorporated into commercial
software).
</p>
<p>
Please see <a href="http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/gap2007braunschweig/gap-package-licensing-info.html">licensing advice</a> for further details.
</p>

<h3>The Package Update Mechanism</h3>

<h4>Setup for Distribution</h4>
<p>
What you have to do to take part in the update mechanism is
also explained in the template  <a
href="PackageInfo.g"><code>PackageInfo.g</code></a> file mentioned above:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a Web page for your package. There are no conditions how this
has to look like. You may take an existing such page (like <a
href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/EDIM">this</a>) and
adjust it for your package.</li>
<li>Produce an archive of your package in (at least) one of the formats
mentioned <a href="/Download/formats.html">here</a>. 
(The update programs can produce 
the missing formats for you.)</li>
<li>Make this archive and as separate files the <code>README</code>  
(containing installation instructions) and the <code>PackageInfo.g</code> 
file accessible by copying them to your Web page or to an ftp-site. (Your 
<code>PackageInfo.g</code>  contains the URLs of these files.)
</li>
<li>Send the URL of your <code>PackageInfo.g</code> file to
<a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Updating a Package Distributed with <mixer var="GAP"/></h4>

<p>Once your package is in the update system, you can  publish
updates as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new archive. Note that you <strong>must</strong> change the
version number of your package. Don't forget to adjust the PackageInfo.g
file and maybe other files to the new version number (the new number must be 
higher, as explained <mixer manual="Example: Version Numbers">here</mixer>). Also the 
name of the archive file must be different from previous names. 
(Just choose a name
which contains the package name and the version number, like
<code>example-1.3.tar.gz</code>.)</li>
<li>Copy the new archive  and <code>README</code> to the URLs given in your
<code>PackageInfo.g</code> file.</li>
<li>Copy the new <code>PackageInfo.g</code> file to the URL given in the 
previous <code>PackageInfo.g</code> file (this is where the update 
mechanism looks for new versions.)</li>
<li>Since publishing the update of your package involves some (small) human
action, please inform
<a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support@gap-system.org</a>
about the update of your package.</li>
<li>After the next update of the GAP distribution, check if the new version of
your package is included there and also listed on the GAP website.</li>
<li>
We advise package authors to maintain an update "history",
which documents the changes from one version to another.
A good example is contained in the 
<a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/design/README.design">README</a>
file of the DESIGN package of Leonard Soicher.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Online Check of a <code>PackageInfo.g</code> File</h3>

<p>
<mixer var="GAP"/> packages must  contain a file
<code>PackageInfo.g</code> in which meta-information is collected:
package name, version, authors/maintainers with contact addresses, location
of download archive(s), infos on provided manuals, ... 
This is used for loading a package into <mixer var="GAP"/> and for a possible
redistribution of a package via the <mixer var="GAP"/> web and ftp sites.
</p> 
<p>See 
<a href="PackageInfo.g">this template file</a> for more details and if you
want to create such a file for your package.
</p>
<p>
One basic check for such a file is provided by the command 
<code>ValidatePackageInfo(filename);</code> from within <mixer var="GAP"/> (at
least 4.4).
</p>
<p>
As further test you can type the URL of a <code>PackageInfo.g</code> file
into this form.
The file is then downloaded and several checks are applied to it. This
should point out to you some common mistakes and hopefully give useful hints
for possible improvements.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this cannot be perfect. 
There may be errors not detected by the script, and it may happen that the
script  complains about points you are actually satisfied with.
</p>
<form action="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/tmp/Packages/checkval" method="post">
<p>
URL of your <code>PackageInfo.g</code> file:<br />
   <input type="text" size="60" maxlength="100" name="url" value=""/>
   <button type="submit">Check/Validate</button>
</p>
<p>
Please, be patient, several programs have to be started for the check, and
files must be downloaded, this can take a little time.
</p>
</form>

<h3>Adjusting Packages from Versions &lt;4.5 </h3>

<p>
The mechanisms for loading and updating packages as described on this page
were first introduced with <mixer var="GAP"/> 4.4 and then improved in <mixer var="GAP"/> 4.5. 
Packages which worked with <mixer var="GAP"/> version &lt;4.4 needed a few adjustments, and 
hints how to achieve this were collected on <a href="pkgauthorhints.html">this page</a>.
To make further use of features introduced in <mixer var="GAP"/> 4.5, we refer to the
<mixer manual="Example: Checklists">
Checklist&nbsp;for&nbsp;package&nbsp;upgrade&nbsp;to&nbsp;work&nbsp;with&nbsp;<mixer var="GAP"/>&nbsp;4.5</mixer>
from the <a href="/Packages/example.html">Example</a> package.
