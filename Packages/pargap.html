<p>
     This package is no longer redistributed with GAP 
     because it no longer can be compiled with GAP 4.9 
     (see <a href="https://mail.gap-system.org/pipermail/gap/2018-March/001082.html">this announcement</a>). 
     Its source code repository, containing the code of the last distributed version, 
     plus some first fixes needed for compatibility for GAP 4.9, can still be found on GitHub
     <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/pargap">here</a>.
     If somebody is interested in repairing this package and taking over its maintenance, 
     so that it can be distributed again, please contact the GAP team.
