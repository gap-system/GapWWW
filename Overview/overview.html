    A {% include ref.html manual="Reference: The Programming Language" text="programming&nbsp;language" %}, 
    also called GAP,

    at the keyboard or to write programs to be saved and then executed.
    Such programs can easily be modified and rerun. The language features:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pascal-like control structures,
      </li>
      <li>

        automatically  choosing the highest ranked method for a certain 
        operation,  depending on the current state of all its arguments, 
        so that GAP objects representing mathematical objects may gain 
        knowledge about themselves during their lifetime  resulting in 
        better methods being chosen later on.

<h3>
  Structure of GAP
</h3>
<p>
  GAP has a kernel written in C. It implements
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    the GAP language,
  </li>
  <li>
    an interactive environment for developing and using
    GAP programs,
  </li>
  <li>
    memory management, and
  </li>
  <li>
    fast versions of time critical operations for various data types. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All the rest of the library of functions is written in the
  GAP language. Packages are mainly written in the
  GAP language, but some also involve standalones. Some
  packages provide links to other systems.
</p>

<h3>
  Requirements and Availability
</h3>
<p>
  The GAP system will run on any machine with a UNIX-like
  or recent Windows or Mac OS X operating system and with a reasonable
  amount of RAM and disk space. The current version is GAP&nbsp;4, but
  <a href="/Gap3/gap3.html">GAP&nbsp;3 </a> is also available, so
  those GAP&nbsp;3 packages that have not yet been converted to
  GAP&nbsp;4 may still be used. Both GAP&nbsp;4 and
  GAP&nbsp;3 may be obtained at no cost by following the
  <a href="/Download/index.html">download</a> instructions.
