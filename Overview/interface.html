GAP has excellent command line features, such as 
{% include ref.html manual="Reference: The Help System" text="help" %}.  
Moreover, GAP  will remember your session "history"  (all the commands
typed in during your GAP session) and allow you to find all previously
issued  commands starting  with  a specific  letter  or sequence.  For
example, <tt>aBcD</tt> by typing

<pre>
gap> aBcD
</pre>

at  the GAP  prompt, followed  by the  <tt>up-arrow</tt>, you  get the
previous command (if any) starting with <tt>aBcD</tt>. To simply cycle
through   the   previous    commands,   just   repeatedly   type   the
<tt>up-arrow</tt> key.

Other "interface" options exist and this page explains some of these.

For xemacs/emacs lovers,  there is a special mode  for GAP users (for
vim users, see the section
{% include ref.html manual="Reference: Editor Support" text="Editor&nbsp;Support" %}
in the GAP reference manual). Note that
by running  GAP within  emacs/xemacs you will  lose, for  example, the
tab-completion  and  the  nice  history  features  of  GAP's  built-in
shell. However,  as a small consolation,  you can edit  out any syntax
mistakes in your  session as you go. The page 
<a href="http://www.usna.edu/Users/math/wdj/gap/gap_emacs.html">
GAP&nbsp;in&nbsp;emacs&nbsp;or&nbsp;xemacs</a> 
has infomation for GAP in linux and GAP in windows.

GAP does  not allow  more than  one line of  comments using  the usual
"Read" command. For debugging and for adding examples to help remember
proper syntax, multi-line  comments would be very useful.  Thanks to a
new command  "ReadNC" written  by Frank Lübeck,  you now  can include
multi-line comments into your file. Frank Lübeck's

allows the reading into GAP of programs with multi-line comments.
