<p>
  It follows from the well known theorems on the algorithmic unsolvability
  of the word problem and related problems that there are no deterministic
  methods to answer most questions about the structure of finitely
  presented groups. For these essentially two approaches are possible:
  On one hand trial-and-error methods such as the Todd-Coxeter and
  Knuth-Bendix methods, on the other hand methods to find certain factor
  groups of described structure, most of which are based on the idea of
  'collection'. For theoretical background of the implemented methods see
  the book [<a href="/Doc/references.html#Si94">Si94</a>] of Charles Sims.
</p>
<p>
  The main GAP library provides methods for handling
  {% include ref.html manual="Reference: Finitely Presented Groups" text="finitely&nbsp;presented&nbsp;groups" %} such as
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Todd-Coxeter,
  </li>
  <li>
    Reidemeister-Schreier,
  </li>
  <li>
    Low Index Subgroups, as well as
  </li>
  <li>
    certain quotient methods.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Also there are functions to handle
  {% include ref.html manual="Reference: Presentations and Tietze Transformations" text="Tietze&nbsp;transformations" %}.
</p>
<p>
  In addition there are packages 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/Packages/fga.html">FGA</a> providing algorithms for
    free groups,
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/Packages/ace.html">ACE</a> linking to a particular
    powerful implementation of the Todd-Coxeter method,
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/Packages/itc.html">ITC</a> providing an interactive
    Todd-Coxeter mainly for teaching and learning,
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/Packages/anupq.html">ANUPQ</a> for finding
    p-quotients, standard presentations, and descendants,
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/Packages/nq.html">NQ</a> for finding infinite
    nilpotent quotients, and
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/Packages/kbmag.html">KBMAG</a> with Knuth-Bendix
    and automatic groups methods. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The packages
