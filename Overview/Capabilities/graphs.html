  The package
  <a href="/Packages/grape.html">GRAPE</a> allows one
  to construct graphs (with or without using  groups), to determine many
  invariants of graphs, to  classify complete subgraphs with various 
  properties, to determine automorphism groups of graphs, and to test 
  graph isomorphism (the  last two via an interface to B.D. McKay's 
  <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/implement/nauty/implement.shtml">
  nauty</a> package).
  A special feature of this package is the use of (subgroups of) the 
  automorphism group of a graph (and hence of permutation group methods) 
  to reduce the store required for many graphs and to reduce the time 
  taken by many graph-theoretical algorithms.

  The package
  <a href="/Packages/guava.html">GUAVA</a> can
  construct many classes of codes, derive invariants such as minimal
  distance and weight distribution and find their automorphism groups.

  The  package
  <a href="/Packages/design.html">Design</a>
  provides classification, partitioning, and study of block designs, 
  including the determination of automorphism groups, the testing of 
  isomorphism, and the calculation of statistical efficiency measures 
  of 1-designs using exact methods.

  The package
  <a href="/Packages/rds.html">RDS</a>
  provides functions for the complete enumeration and construction 
  of relative difference sets and the corresponding projective planes. 
  The constructed planes can be analysed using the
  <a href="/Packages/design.html">Design</a> package.
