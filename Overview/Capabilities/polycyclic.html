<p>
Polycyclic groups (both finite and infinite) have special generating 
sets which are compatible with the polycyclic structure of the underlying
group. These allow highly efficient computation in polycyclic groups. For
example, there are effective algorithms available to compute:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>centralizers of elements</li>  
  <li>normalizers of subgroups</li>
  <li>intersections of subgroups</li>
  <li>complements to normal subgroups</li>
  <li>cohomology groups</li>
</ul>

<p>
Methods for this purpose are contained in the main GAP 
library for finite polycyclic groups and in the 
<a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/polycyclic/">Polycyclic</a> package 
for arbitrary polycyclic groups.
</p>

<p>
The main GAP library also contains methods for special 
structure investigations in finite soluble groups such as the computation 
of Hall subgroups, Sylow systems and maximal subgroups. The packages
<a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/format/">FORMAT</a> and
<a href="http://www.icm.tu-bs.de/~bhoeflin/crisp/index.html">CRISP</a>
extend this to the computation of all kinds of formation and Schunk 
classes related structures.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/polycyclic/">Polycyclic</a> package also 
contains methods for special structure investigations in infinite 
polycyclic groups such as the computation of the Hirsch length, 
the torsion subgroup (if it exists) or a torsion free normal 
subgroup of finite index. It utilizes an interface to the
<a href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">PARI/GP</a> system from
the <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/alnuth">Alnuth</a> package.
</p>  

<p>
For finite polycyclic groups it is also possible to determine the
automorphism group or a minimal generating set. The 
<a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/autpgrp/">AutPGrp</a>  package
contains a particularly effective method to determine 
the automorphism group of a finite <i>p</i>-group.
</p>

<p>
The package <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/polenta/">Polenta</a> 
allows to determine a polycyclic presentation for
polycyclic matrix groups over finite fields or the rational numbers. 
The main GAP library contains a method to determine a polycyclic 
presentation for permutation groups. 
The <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/nq/">nq</a> and <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/anupq/">ANUPQ</a>
packages contain methods to determine polycyclic presentations for nilpotent 
or p-group quotients of finitely presented groups, respectively.
