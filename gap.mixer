<h3>
  What is <mixer var="GAP"/>?
</h3>
<p>
  <mixer var="GAP"/> is a system for computational discrete algebra, with
  particular emphasis on
  <a href="/Doc/references.html">Computational&nbsp;Group&nbsp;Theory</a>.
  <mixer var="GAP"/> provides a
  <mixer manual="Reference: The Programming Language">
  programming&nbsp;language</mixer>, a library of thousands of
  functions implementing
  algebraic algorithms written in the <mixer var="GAP"/> language as well
  as large <a href="/Datalib/datalib.html">data&nbsp;libraries</a> of
  algebraic objects. See also the
  <a href="/Overview/overview.html">overview</a> and the description of the
  <a href="/Overview/Capabilities/capabilities.html">
  mathematical&nbsp;capabilities</a>.
  <mixer var="GAP"/> is used in
  research and teaching for studying groups and their representations,
  rings, vector spaces, algebras,
  combinatorial structures, and more. The system, including source, is
  distributed <a href="/Download/copyright.html#free">freely</a>.  
  You can study and easily modify or extend it for your special use.
</p>
<p>
In July 2008, GAP was awarded the <i>ACM/SIGSAM
Richard Dimick <a href="http://www.sigsam.org/awards/jenks/index.html">Jenks 
Memorial Prize</a> for Excellence in
Software Engineering applied to Computer Algebra</i>.
